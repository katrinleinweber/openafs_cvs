* Bugfixes:

All systems:

- fileserver host tracking code had a missing lock on a host structure;
  that lock has been added.

- fileserver handling for clients which are giving up callbacks did not
  hold a lock, making it unsafe and allowing clients to potentially 
  crash the server by racing. 

- fileserver will now leave a corefile when it is doing a shutdown due
  to error conditions.

- fileserver again allows ufs as a valid filesystem type (regression in 1.4.5).

- cbd handler for fileserver status data has an interpretation error which
  could cause crashes corrected.

- fileserver accurately tracks number of callbacks on a given file.
