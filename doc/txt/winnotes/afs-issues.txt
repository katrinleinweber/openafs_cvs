This file is a rough list of known issues with the 1.5.27 release of OpenAFS 
on Windows.  This list is not complete.  There are probably other issues which 
can be found in the RT database or on the mailing list.

For all of these issues please review 

  http://www.openafs.org/roadmap.html
  http://www.secure-endpoints.com/openafs-windows-roadmap.html


(1) File/Directory access is not integrated with windows security 

(3c) Loopback adapter hack:
  (i)   prevents use of AFS Gateway 
  (ii)  requires installation of loopback adapter

(9) Convert to a native file system implementation built upon:
     - a file system redirector
     - a file system filter
     - a network provider

(12) AFS Integrated Logon:
(12c) If network is not available must store the username and password 
      somewhere until such time as the network starts.

(14) No support for Unicode CIFS/SMB data structures.  OEM Code Pages prevent
     the use of interoperable file names; force the use of paths no longer 
     than 256 characters; force share names to be no longer than 13 
     characters; restrict authentication to ASCII only names and passwords;
     etc.

(16) Better EventLog handling

(17) Named Pipes Support [requires modifications to AFS servers to support]

(18) Memory Mapped File support

(20) NSIS Installer issues
     (a) integration with KFW install script
     (b) Optional removal of AFS Server volumes

(21) The User Interface needs to be re-designed to separate the per-user
     and per-machine settings.  All of the new registry items need to 
     be added to the UI

(22) CIFS Remote Administration Protocol implementation is incomplete.
     Notifications are not made to requestors when the view of a file
     or folder changes due to token acquisition; token expiration; or
     token destruction

(23) Remove submount creation as a side effect of AFS drive mapping.
     
     The AFS Submount is effectively a server side alias for a path 
     located in the AFS space.  This alias is exported by the AFS 
     SMB/CIFS Server to the Windows SMB/CIFS client as a Share name.  
     This makes the AFS Submount a system global setting which should 
     only be modified by a member of the "AFS Client Admin" group.

     afs_creds.exe and afs_config.exe should be modified to no longer 
     use submount names when creating drive maps.  Drive maps should 
     simply use the full AFS path name.  Submounts should not be 
     created as a side effect of a drive mapping.

     The creation of submounts should only be possible via afsshare.exe 
     or by the new AFS Client Service Administration tool when executed 
     by an authorized user.

(24) Compatibility with Vista User Account Control (UAC)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
List of unfunded projects:

   4. Add support for Named Pipes within the afs filesystem
      (This is not currently a supported feature of AFS; it will require 
      changes to the servers as well as the clients.)
   6. Re-write afs_config.exe to be only "per user" functionality which does not require admin 
      privileges
         1. default cell and principal for the user
         2. drive mappings but no submounts
         3. visibility of afs creds and setting of afs creds startup options
   7. Create new afs_admin.exe tool to be installed in the administrator folder (or use MMS) 
      which contains
         1. afs client service cell name
         2. integrated logon configuration
         3. Gateway configuration
         4. start/stop service
         5. global drive mapping
         6. submount management
         7. file/volume server preferences
         8. afs cells
         9. cache configuration
        10. diagnostics
        11. network configuration
        12. miscellaneous
        13. need to add support for all of the new registry values since 1.2.8
  10. Add support for configurable Icon file representing AFS folders within the Explorer Shell
  11. Documentation Documentation Documentation
  13. Integrate KFW installation into the NSIS and MSI installers
  14. Add support for server side byte range locking.
  15. Unicode enable the SMB/CIFS server.  OEM Code Pages: 
      1. prevent the use of interoperable file names
      2. force the use of paths no longer than 256 characters
      3. force share names to be no longer than 13 characters
      4. restrict authentication to ASCII only names and passwords
  16. Complete implementation of CIFS Remote Administration Protocol
  17. Add support for SMB/CIFS Digital Signatures
  18. Missing SMB/CIFS functions: 
        Find
        FindUnique
        FindClose
        ReadBulk
        WriteBulk       
        WriteBulkData
        Tran2::SessionSetup
	Tran2::Directory Search InfoLevel 0x105 / 0x106
  19. StoreBehind mode is not implemented.  Or more correctly, all data is
      written directly to the server and is not cached.  Writes invalidate
      the local cache entries which are then read back from the server.
  20. Develop an optional Installable File System replacement for the SMB/CIFS 
      Server.
  21. Add support for storing Extended Attributes on files
  22. Add support for storing Windows ACLs on files
  23. Remove submount creation as a side effect of drive creation
  24. Finish conversion from string.h to strsafe.h for VS.NET 2005
  25. Implement RX Statistics gathering interfaces and reporting tools
      (necessary to obtain profiling data)
  26. Implement RX Connection Pools in the Cache Manager allowing more than
      four simultaneous requests to a single server to be processed at a time 
      for a single user
  27. Support the Vista User Account Control (UAC) interface
