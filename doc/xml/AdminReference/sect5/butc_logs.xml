    <title>Description</title>
    <para>The Backup System Tape Coordinator (<emphasis role="bold">butc</emphasis>) process generates two log
    files per device, one for error messages and one for actions.</para>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Error Message Log</title>
      <para>The <replaceable>TE_</replaceable><emphasis>device_name</emphasis><replaceable></replaceable> file logs error messages generated by the Backup
      System Tape Coordinator that controls the tape device or backup data file
      indicated by <emphasis>device_name</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>As the Tape Coordinator initializes, it creates the file in ASCII format
      in the <replaceable>/usr/afs/backup</replaceable> directory. If there is an existing file, the
      Tape Coordinator renames it to <replaceable>TE_</replaceable><emphasis>device_name</emphasis><replaceable>.old</replaceable>&gt;, overwriting the
      existing <replaceable>TE_</replaceable><emphasis>device_name</emphasis><replaceable>.old</replaceable>&gt; file if it exists.</para>

      <para>For a tape device, the Tape Coordinator derives the variable
      <emphasis>device_name</emphasis> portion of the filename from the device pathname listed in
      the local <replaceable>/usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig</replaceable> file, by stripping off the initial
      <computeroutput>/dev/</computeroutput> string and replacing any other slashes in the name with
      underscores. For example, the filename for a device called <replaceable>/dev/rmt/4m</replaceable>
      is <replaceable>TE_rmt_4m</replaceable>. Similarly, for a backup data file the Tape Coordinator
      strips off the initial slash (<computeroutput>/</computeroutput>) and replaces any other slashes in the
      name with underscores. For example, the filename for a backup data file
      called <replaceable>/var/tmp/FILE</replaceable> is <replaceable>TE_var_tmp_FILE</replaceable>.</para>

      <para>The messages in the file describe the error and warning conditions the
      Tape Coordinator encounters as it operates. For instance, a message can
      list the volumes that are inaccessible during a dump operation, or warn
      that the Tape Coordinator is overwriting a tape or backup data file. The
      messages also appear in the <replaceable>/usr/afs/backup/TL_</replaceable><emphasis>device_name</emphasis><replaceable></replaceable> file,
      which traces most of the Tape Coordinator's actions.</para>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Action Log</title>
      <para>The <replaceable>TL_</replaceable><emphasis>device_name</emphasis><replaceable></replaceable> file logs the actions performed by the Backup
      System Tape Coordinator that controls the tape device or backup data file
      indicated by <emphasis>device_name</emphasis>. It also records the same error and warning
      messages written to the <replaceable>TE_</replaceable><emphasis>device_name</emphasis><replaceable></replaceable> file.</para>

      <para>As the Tape Coordinator initializes, it creates the file in ASCII format
      in the <replaceable>/usr/afs/backup</replaceable> directory. If there is an existing file, the
      Tape Coordinator renames it to <replaceable>TL_</replaceable><emphasis>device_name</emphasis><replaceable>.old</replaceable>, overwriting the
      existing <replaceable>TL_</replaceable><emphasis>device_name</emphasis><replaceable>.old</replaceable> file if it exists.</para>

      <para>For a tape device, the Tape Coordinator derives the variable
      <emphasis>device_name</emphasis> portion of the filename from the device pathname listed in
      the local <replaceable>/usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig</replaceable> file, by stripping off the initial
      <computeroutput>/dev/</computeroutput> string and replacing any other slashes in the name with
      underscores. For example, the filename for a device called <replaceable>/dev/rmt/4m</replaceable>
      is <replaceable>TL_rmt_4m</replaceable>. Similarly, for a backup data file the Tape Coordinator
      strips off the initial slash (<computeroutput>/</computeroutput>) and replaces any other slashes in the
      name with underscores. For example, the filename for a backup data file
      called <replaceable>/var/tmp/FILE</replaceable> is <replaceable>TL_var_tmp_FILE</replaceable>.</para>
