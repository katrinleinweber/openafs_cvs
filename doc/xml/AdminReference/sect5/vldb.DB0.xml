    <title>Description</title>
    <para>The file <replaceable>vldb.DB0</replaceable> contains the Volume Location Database (VLDB), which
    tracks the location of all AFS volumes stored on file server machines in
    the cell. The Volume Location (VL) Server (<emphasis role="bold">vlserver</emphasis> process) provides
    information from the database to Cache Managers when they need to access
    AFS data.</para>

    <para>The file <replaceable>vldb.DBSYS1</replaceable> is a log file in which the VL Server logs each
    database operation before performing it. When an operation is interrupted,
    the VL Server replays the log to complete the operation.</para>

    <para>Both files are in binary format and reside in the <replaceable>/usr/afs/db</replaceable> directory
    on each of the cell's database server machines. When the VL Server starts
    or restarts on a given machine, it establishes a connection with its peers
    and verifies that its copy of the database matches the copy on the other
    database server machines. If not, the VL Servers call on AFS's distributed
    database technology, Ubik, to distribute to all of the machines the copy
    of the database with the highest version number.</para>

    <para>Always use the commands in the <emphasis role="bold">vos</emphasis> suite to administer the VLDB. It is
    advisable to create an archive copy of the database on a regular basis,
    using a tool such as the UNIX <emphasis role="bold">tar</emphasis> command.</para>
