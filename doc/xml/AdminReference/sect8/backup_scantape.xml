    <title>Description</title>
    <para>The <emphasis role="bold">backup scantape</emphasis> command extracts information from the dump labels
    and volume headers on the tape in the device controlled by the Tape
    Coordinator indicated by the <emphasis role="bold">-portoffset</emphasis> argument. The Tape Coordinator
    displays the information for each volume in its window as soon as it
    extracts it (rather than waiting until it has scanned the entire tape).</para>

    <para>(If the <computeroutput>FILE YES</computeroutput> instruction appears in the
    <replaceable>/usr/afs/backup/CFG_</replaceable><emphasis>device_name</emphasis><replaceable></replaceable> file associated with the specified
    port offset, then the <emphasis role="bold">backup scantape</emphasis> command extracts dump information
    from the backup data file named in that port offset's entry in the
    <replaceable>/usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig</replaceable> file on the Tape Coordinator machine, rather
    than from a tape. For the sake of clarity, the following text refers to
    tapes only, but the Backup System handles backup data files in much the
    same way.)</para>

    <para>If the <emphasis role="bold">-dbadd</emphasis> flag is provided, the backup scantape command creates new
    dump and volume records in the Backup Database for the scanned
    information. However, if it finds that a record already exists in the
    database for the same dump, it terminates the scanning operation.</para>

    <para>The scanning operation works only on tapes containing volume data.  The
    command fails with an error message if the tape contains a copy of the
    Backup Database (was created with the <emphasis role="bold">backup savedb</emphasis> command, or has the
    AFS tape name <computeroutput>Ubik_db_dump.1</computeroutput>).</para>

    <para>The Tape Coordinator's default response to this command is to access the
    tape by invoking the <computeroutput>MOUNT</computeroutput> instruction in the <replaceable>CFG_</replaceable><emphasis>device_name</emphasis><replaceable></replaceable>
    file, or by prompting the backup operator to insert the tape if there is
    no <computeroutput>MOUNT</computeroutput> instruction.  However, if the <computeroutput>AUTOQUERY NO</computeroutput> instruction
    appears in the <replaceable>CFG_</replaceable><emphasis>device_name</emphasis><replaceable></replaceable> file, or if the issuer of the <emphasis role="bold">butc</emphasis>
    command included the <emphasis role="bold">-noautoquery</emphasis> flag, the Tape Coordinator instead
    expects the tape to be in the device already. If it is not, the Tape
    Coordinator invokes the <computeroutput>MOUNT</computeroutput> instruction or prompts the operator.</para>

    <para>To terminate a tape scanning operation in interactive mode, issue the
    <emphasis role="bold">backup kill</emphasis> command. In noninteractive mode, the only choice is to use
    a termination signal such as Ctrl-C to halt the Tape Coordinator
    completely.</para>

  </refsect1>
  <refsect1>
    <title>Cautions</title>
    <para>A scanning operation does not have to begin with the first tape in a dump
    set, but the Backup System can process tapes only in sequential order
    after the initial tape provided. The Tape Coordinator automatically
    requests any subsequent tapes by invoking the <computeroutput>MOUNT</computeroutput> instruction in the
    local <replaceable>/usr/afs/backup/CFG_</replaceable><emphasis>device_name</emphasis><replaceable></replaceable> file, or by prompting the
    operator if there is no <computeroutput>MOUNT</computeroutput> instruction.</para>

    <para>The Tape Coordinator's success in scanning a tape that is corrupted or
    damaged depends on the extent of the damage and what type of data is
    corrupted. It can almost always scan the tape successfully up to the point
    of damage. If the damage is minor, the Tape Coordinator can usually skip
    over it and scan the rest of the tape, but more major damage can prevent
    further scanning. Because a scanning operation can start on any tape in a
    dump set, damage on one tape does not prevent scanning of the others in
    the dump set. However, it is possible to scan either the tapes that
    precede the damaged one or the ones that follow it, but not both.</para>

    <para>If a tape is relabeled with the backup labeltape command, it is not
    possible to recover data from it for the purposes of rebuilding the Backup
    Database.</para>

    <para>If the <emphasis role="bold">-dbadd</emphasis> flag is included on the command, it is best not to
    terminate the tape scanning operation before it completes (for example, by
    issuing the <emphasis role="bold">backup kill</emphasis> command in interactive mode). The Backup System
    writes a new record in the Backup Database for each dump as soon as it
    scans the relevant information on the tape, and so it possibly has already
    written new records. If the operator wants to rerun the scanning
    operation, he or she must locate and remove the records created during the
    terminated operation: the second operation exits automatically if it finds
    that a record that it needs to create already exists.</para>

    <para>If the <emphasis role="bold">-dbadd</emphasis> flag is included and the first tape provided is not the
    first tape in the dump set, the following restrictions apply:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>If the first data on the tape is a continuation of a volume that begins on
        the previous (unscanned) tape in the dump set, the Backup System does not
        add a record for that volume to the Backup Database.</para>

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The Backup System must read the marker that indicates the start of an
        appended dump to add database records for the volumes in it. If the first
        volume on the tape belongs to an appended dump, but is not immediately
        preceded by the appended-dump marker, the Backup System does not create a
        Backup Database record for it or any subsequent volumes that belong to
        that appended dump.</para>

    <title>Output</title>
    <para>For every dump on a tape, the backup scantape command displays in the Tape

    the dump. If a dump spans more than one tape, the dump label does not
    repeat at the beginning of subsequent tapes.</para>

    <para>A dump label contains the following fields, which are the same as in the
    output from the <emphasis role="bold">backup readlabel</emphasis> command:</para>

          argument is used again, no matter how many times the tape is recycled or
          otherwise relabeled. If the tape does not have a permanent name, the value

    <para>In normal circumstances, the Backup System writes a marker to indicate
    that a volume is the last one on a tape, or that the volume continues on
    the next tape. However, if a backup operation terminated abnormally (for
    example, because the operator terminated the Tape Coordinator by issuing
    the Ctrl-C command during the operation), then there is no such
    marker. Some very early versions of the Backup System also did not write
    these markers. If a tape does not conclude with one of the expected
    markers, the Tape Coordinator cannot determine if there is a subsequent
    tape in the dump set and so generates the following message in its window:</para>
