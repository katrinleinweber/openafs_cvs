    <title>Description</title>
    <para>The <emphasis role="bold">backup volsetrestore</emphasis> command restores the complete contents of a
    group of read/write volumes to the file system, by restoring data from the
    last full dump and all subsequent incremental dumps of each volume.  It is
    most useful for recovering from loss of data on multiple partitions, since
    it can restore each of a defined set of volumes to a different site.</para>

    <para>(If the <computeroutput>FILE YES</computeroutput> instruction appears in the
    <replaceable>/usr/afs/backup/CFG_</replaceable><emphasis>device_name</emphasis><replaceable></replaceable> file associated with the specified
    port offset, then the <emphasis role="bold">backup volsetrestore</emphasis> command restores data from
    the backup data file listed for that port offset in the Tape Coordinator's
    <replaceable>/usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig</replaceable> file, instead of from tape. For the sake of
    clarity, the following text refers to tapes only, but the Backup System
    handles backup data files in much the same way.)</para>

    <para>If restoring one or more volumes to a single site only, it is usually more
    efficient to use the <emphasis role="bold">backup volrestore</emphasis> command. If restoring all
    volumes that resided on a single partition, it is usually more efficient
    to use the <emphasis role="bold">backup diskrestore</emphasis> command.</para>

    <para>Indicate the volumes to restore by providing either the <emphasis role="bold">-name</emphasis> argument
    or the <emphasis role="bold">-file</emphasis> argument:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The <emphasis role="bold">-name</emphasis> argument names a volume set. The Backup System restores all
        volumes listed in the Volume Location Database (VLDB) that match the
        server, partition, and volume name criteria defined in the volume set's
        volume entries, and for which dumps are available. It restores the volumes
        to their current site (machine and partition), and by default overwrites
        the existing volume contents.</para>

        <para>It is not required that the volume set was previously used to back up
        volumes (was used as the <emphasis role="bold">-volumeset</emphasis> option to the <emphasis role="bold">backup dump</emphasis>
        command). It can be defined especially to match the volumes that need to
        be restored with this command, and that is usually the better
        choice. Indeed, a <emphasis>temporary</emphasis> volume set, created by including the
        <emphasis role="bold">-temporary</emphasis> flag to the <emphasis role="bold">backup addvolset</emphasis> command, can be especially
        useful in this context. A temporary volume set is not added to the Backup
        Database and exists only during the current interactive backup session,
        which is suitable if the volume set is needed only to complete the single
        restore operation initialized by this command.</para>

        <para>The reason that a specially defined volume set is probably better is that
        volume sets previously defined for use in dump operations usually match
        the backup version of volumes, whereas for a restore operation it is best
        to define volume entries that match the base (read/write) name. In that
        case, the Backup System searches the Backup Database for the newest dump
        set that includes either the read/write or the backup version of the
        volume. If, in contrast, a volume entry explicitly matches the volume's
        backup or read-only version, the Backup System restores dumps of that
        volume version only.</para>

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The <emphasis role="bold">-file</emphasis> argument names a file that lists specific volumes and the
        site to which to restore each. The volume name must match the name used in
        Backup Database dump records rather than in the VLDB, if they differ,
        because the Backup System does not look up volumes in the VLDB. The
        specified site can be different than the volume's current one; in that
        case, the Backup System removes the current version of the volume and
        updates the volume's location information in the VLDB.</para>

      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>If all of the full and incremental dumps of all relevant volumes were not
    written to a type of tape that a single Tape Coordinator can read, use the
    <emphasis role="bold">-portoffset</emphasis> argument to list multiple port offset numbers in the order
    in which the tapes are needed (first list the port offset for the full
    dump, second the port offset for the level 1 incremental dump, and so
    on). This implies that the full dumps of all relevant volumes must have
    been written to a type of tape that the first Tape Coordinator can read,
    the level 1 incremental dumps to a type of tape the second Tape
    Coordinator can read, and so on. If dumps are on multiple incompatible
    tape types, use the <emphasis role="bold">backup volrestore</emphasis> command to restore individual
    volumes, or use this command after defining new volume sets that group
    together volumes that were dumped to compatible tape types. For further
    discussion, see the <emphasis>IBM AFS Administration Guide</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>By default, the Backup System overwrites the contents of an existing
    volume with the restored data. To create a new volume to house the
    restored version instead, use the <emphasis role="bold">-extension</emphasis> argument. The Backup
    System derives the new volume's name by adding the specified extension to
    the read/write base name, and creates a new VLDB entry. The command does
    not affect the existing volume in any way. However, if a volume with the
    specified extension also already exists, the command overwrites it.</para>

    <para>The <emphasis role="bold">-n</emphasis> flag produces a list of the volumes to be restored if the <emphasis role="bold">-n</emphasis>
    flag were not included, without actually restoring any volumes. See
    <link linkend="OUTPUT">OUTPUT</link> for a detailed description of the output, and suggestions on how
    to combine it most effectively with the <emphasis role="bold">-file</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">-name</emphasis> arguments.</para>

    <para>The execution time for a <emphasis role="bold">backup volsetrestore</emphasis> command depends on the
    number of volumes to be restored and the amount of data in them, but it
    can take hours to restore a large number of volumes. One way to reduce the
    time is to run multiple instances of the command simultaneously, either
    using the <emphasis role="bold">-name</emphasis> argument to specify disjoint volume sets for each
    command, or the <emphasis role="bold">-file</emphasis> argument to name files that list different
    volumes. This is possible if there are multiple available Tape
    Coordinators that can read the required tapes. Depending on how the
    volumes to be restored were dumped to tape, specifying disjoint volume
    sets can also reduce the number of tape changes required.</para>

    <para>The Tape Coordinator's default response to this command is to access the
    first tape it needs by invoking the <computeroutput>MOUNT</computeroutput> instruction in the local
    <replaceable>/usr/afs/backup/CFG_</replaceable><emphasis>device_name</emphasis><replaceable></replaceable> file, or by prompting the backup
    operator to insert the tape if there is no <computeroutput>MOUNT</computeroutput> instruction. However,
    if the <computeroutput>AUTOQUERY NO</computeroutput> instruction appears in the <replaceable>CFG_</replaceable><emphasis>device_name</emphasis><replaceable></replaceable>
    file, or if the issuer of the <emphasis role="bold">butc</emphasis> command included the <emphasis role="bold">-noautoquery</emphasis>
    flag, the Tape Coordinator instead expects the tape to be in the device
    already. If it is not, or is the wrong tape, the Tape Coordinator invokes
    the <computeroutput>MOUNT</computeroutput> instruction or prompts the operator. It also invokes the
    <computeroutput>MOUNT</computeroutput> instruction or prompts for any additional tapes needed to
    complete the restore operation; the backup operator must arrange to
    provide them.</para>

                  of that version of the volume, starting with the most recent full
                  dump. If, in contrast, the name explicitly includes the <computeroutput>.backup</computeroutput> or

        file. The <emphasis>IBM AFS Administration Guide</emphasis> section on using the Backup
        System to restore data explains how to edit the file as necessary before
        using it as input to the <emphasis role="bold">-file</emphasis> argument.</para>

        <para>The output of this command includes only volumes for which the Backup
        Database includes at least one dump record. The command interpreter
        generates a message on the standard error stream about volumes that do not
        have dump records but either are listed in the file named by the <emphasis role="bold">-file</emphasis>
        argument, or appear in the VLDB as a match to a volume entry in the volume
        set named by the <emphasis role="bold">-name</emphasis> argument.</para>

        <para>The following command restores all volumes included in entries in the
        volume set named <computeroutput>data.restore</computeroutput>, which was created expressly to restore
        data to a pair of file server machines on which all data was corrupted due
        to a software error. All volumes are restored to the sites recorded in
        their entries in the VLDB.</para>
