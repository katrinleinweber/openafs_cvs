    <title>Description</title>
    <para>The <emphasis role="bold">udebug</emphasis> command displays the status of the lightweight Ubik process
    for the database server process identified by the <emphasis role="bold">-port</emphasis> argument that
    is running on the database server machine named by the <emphasis role="bold">-servers</emphasis>
    argument. The output identifies the machines where peer database server
    processes are running, which of them is the synchronization site (Ubik
    coordinator), and the status of the connections between them.</para>

    <title>Output</title>
    <para>Several of the messages in the output provide basic status information
    about the Ubik process on the machine specified by the <emphasis role="bold">-servers</emphasis>
    argument, and the remaining messages are useful mostly for debugging
    purposes.</para>

    <para>To check basic Ubik status, issue the command for each database server
    machine in turn. In the output for each, one of the following messages
    appears in the top third of the output.</para>

<programlisting>
   I am sync site . . . (&amp;lt;#_sites&amp;gt; servers)

</programlisting>
<programlisting>
   I am not sync site

</programlisting>
        <para>For the synchronization site, the following message indicates that all
        sites have the same version of the database, which implies that Ubik is
        functioning correctly. See the following for a description of values other
        than <computeroutput>1f</computeroutput>.</para>

<programlisting>
   Recovery state 1f

</programlisting>
          <para>For correct Ubik operation, the database server machine clocks must agree
          on the time. The following messages, which are the second and third lines
          in the output, report the current date and time according to the database
          server machine's clock and the clock on the machine where the <emphasis role="bold">udebug</emphasis>
          command is issued.</para>

<programlisting>
   Host's &amp;lt;IP_addr&amp;gt; time is &amp;lt;dbserver_date/time&amp;gt;
   Local time is &amp;lt;local_date/time&amp;gt; (time differential &amp;lt;skew&amp;gt; secs)

</programlisting>
            <para>The &lt;skew&gt; is the difference between the database server machine clock and
            the local clock. Its absolute value is not vital for Ubik functioning, but
            a difference of more than a few seconds between the <emphasis>skew</emphasis> values for the
            database server machines indicates that their clocks are not synchronized
            and Ubik performance is possibly hampered.</para>

            <para>Following is a description of all messages in the output. As noted, it is
            useful mostly for debugging and most meaningful to someone who understands
            Ubik's implementation.</para>

            <para>The output begins with the following messages. The first message reports
            the IP addresses that are configured with the operating system on the
            machine specified by the <emphasis role="bold">-servers</emphasis> argument. As previously noted, the
            second and third messages report the current date and time according to
            the clocks on the database server machine and the machine where the
            <emphasis role="bold">udebug</emphasis> command is issued, respectively. All subsequent timestamps in
            the output are expressed in terms of the local clock rather than the
            database server machine clock.</para>

<programlisting>
   Host's addresses are: &amp;lt;list_of_IP_addrs&amp;gt;
   Host's &amp;lt;IP_addr&amp;gt; time is &amp;lt;dbserver_date/time&amp;gt;
   Local time is &amp;lt;local_date/time&amp;gt; (time differential &amp;lt;skew&amp;gt; secs)

</programlisting>
              <para>If the &lt;skew&gt; is more than about 10 seconds, the following message
              appears. As noted, it does not necessarily indicate Ubik malfunction: it
              denotes clock skew between the database server machine and the local
              machine, rather than among the database server machines.</para>

<programlisting>
   ****clock may be bad

</programlisting>
                <para>If the udebug command is issued during the coordinator election process
                and voting has not yet begun, the following message appears next.</para>

<programlisting>
   Last yes vote not cast yet

</programlisting>
                  <para>Otherwise, the output continues with the following messages.</para>

<programlisting>
   Last yes vote for &amp;lt;sync_IP_addr&amp;gt; was &amp;lt;last_vote&amp;gt; secs ago (sync site);
   Last vote started &amp;lt;vote_start&amp;gt; secs ago (at &amp;lt;date/time&amp;gt;)
   Local db version is &amp;lt;db_version&amp;gt;

</programlisting>
                    <para>The first indicates which peer this Ubik process last voted for as
                    coordinator (it can vote for itself) and how long ago it sent the vote.
                    The second message indicates how long ago the Ubik coordinator requested
                    confirming votes from the secondary sites. Usually, the &lt;last_vote&gt; and
                    &lt;vote_start&gt; values are the same; a difference between them can indicate
                    clock skew or a slow network connection between the two database server
                    machines. A small difference is not harmful. The third message reports the
                    current version number &lt;db_version&gt; of the database maintained by this
                    Ubik process. It has two fields separated by a period. The field before
                    the period is based on a timestamp that reflects when the database first
                    changed after the most recent coordinator election, and the field after
                    the period indicates the number of changes since the election.</para>

                    <para>The output continues with messages that differ depending on whether the
                    Ubik process is the coordinator or not.</para>

                      <listitem>
                        <para>If there is only one database server machine, it is always the coordinator
                        (synchronization site), as indicated by the following message.</para>

<programlisting>
   I am sync site forever (1 server)

                        <listitem>
                          <para>If there are multiple database sites, and the <emphasis role="bold">-servers</emphasis> argument names
                          the coordinator (synchronization site), the output continues with the
                          following two messages.</para>

<programlisting>
   I am sync site until &amp;lt;expiration&amp;gt; secs from now (at &amp;lt;date/time&amp;gt;)
       (&amp;lt;#_sites&amp;gt; servers)
   Recovery state &amp;lt;flags&amp;gt;

</programlisting>
                            <para>The first message (which is reported on one line) reports how much longer
                            the site remains coordinator even if the next attempt to maintain quorum
                            fails, and how many sites are participating in the quorum. The <emphasis>flags</emphasis>
                            field in the second message is a hexadecimal number that indicates the
                            current state of the quorum. A value of <computeroutput>1f</computeroutput> indicates complete database
                            synchronization, whereas a value of <computeroutput>f</computeroutput> means that the coordinator has
                            the correct database but cannot contact all secondary sites to determine
                            if they also have it. Lesser values are acceptable if the <emphasis role="bold">udebug</emphasis>
                            command is issued during coordinator election, but they denote a problem
                            if they persist. The individual flags have the following meanings:</para>

                                        <para>Including the <emphasis role="bold">-long</emphasis> flag produces peer entries even when the
                                        <emphasis role="bold">-servers</emphasis> argument names a secondary site, but in that case only the
                                        <emphasis>IP_address</emphasis> field is guaranteed to be accurate. For example, the value
                                        in the &lt;db_version&gt; field is usually <computeroutput>0.0</computeroutput>, because secondary sites do
                                        not poll their peers for this information.  The values in the <emphasis>last_vote</emphasis>
                                        and <emphasis>last_beacon</emphasis> fields indicate when this site last received or
                                        requested a vote as coordinator; they generally indicate the time of the
                                        last coordinator election.</para>
