=head1 DESCRIPTION

The bos salvage command salvages (restores internal consistency
to) one or more volumes on the file server machine named by the
B<-server> argument. When processing one or more partitions,
the command restores consistency to corrupted read/write volumes where
possible. For read-only or backup volumes, it inspects only the volume
header:

=over 4

=item *

If the volume header is corrupted, the Salvager removes the volume
completely and records the removal in its log file,
B</usr/afs/logs/SalvageLog>. Issue the B<vos release>
or B<vos backup> command to create the read-only or backup volume
again.


=item *

If the volume header is intact, the Salvager skips the volume (does not
check for corruption in the contents). However, if the File Server
notices corruption as it initializes, it sometimes refuses to attach the
volume or bring it online. In this case, it is simplest to remove the
volume by issuing the B<vos remove> or B<vos zap>
command. Then issue the B<vos release> or B<vos backup>
command to create it again.


=back

Use the indicated arguments to salvage a specific number of volumes:

=over 4

=item *

To process all volumes on a file server machine, provide the
B<-server> argument and the B<-all> flag. No volumes on
the machine are accessible to Cache Managers during the salvage operation,
because the BOS Server stops the File Server and Volume Server processes while
the Salvager runs. The BOS Server automatically restarts them when the
operation completes.


=item *

To process all volumes on one partition, provide the -server
and B<-partition> arguments. As for a salvage of the entire
machine, no volumes on the machine are accessible to Cache Managers during the
salvage operation. The BOS Server automatically restarts the File
Server and Volume Server when the operation completes.


=item *

To salvage only one read/write volume, combine the -server,
B<-partition>, and B<-volume> arguments. Only that
volume is inaccessible to Cache Managers, because the BOS Server does not
shutdown the File Server and Volume Server processes during the salvage of a
single volume. Do not name a read-only or backup volume with the
B<-volume> argument. Instead, remove the volume, using the
B<vos remove> or B<vos zap> command. Then create a new
copy of the volume with the B<vos release> or B<vos backup>
command.


=back

During the salvage of an entire machine or partition, the bos
status command reports the B<fs> process's auxiliary status
as C<Salvaging file system>.

The Salvager always writes a trace to the
B</usr/afs/logs/SalvageLog> file on the file server machine where it
runs. To record the trace in another file as well (either in AFS or on
the local disk of the machine where the B<bos salvage> command is
issued), name the file with the B<-file> argument. To display
the trace on the standard output stream as it is written to the
B</usr/afs/logs/SalvageLog> file, include the B<-showlog>
flag.

By default, multiple Salvager subprocesses run in parallel: one for
each partition up to four, and four subprocesses for four or more
partitions. To increase or decrease the number of subprocesses running
in parallel, provide a positive integer value for the B<-parallel>
argument.

If there is more than one server partition on a physical disk, the Salvager
by default salvages them serially to avoid the inefficiency of constantly
moving the disk head from one partition to another. However, this
strategy is often not ideal if the partitions are configured as logical
volumes that span multiple disks. To force the Salvager to salvage
logical volumes in parallel, provide the string B<all> as the value
for the B<-parallel> argument. Provide a positive integer to
specify the number of subprocesses to run in parallel (for example,
B<-parallel 5all> for five subprocesses), or omit the integer to run
up to four subprocesses, depending on the number of logical volumes being
salvaged.

The Salvager creates temporary files as it runs, by default writing them to
the partition it is salvaging. The number of files can be quite large,
and if the partition is too full to accommodate them, the Salvager terminates
without completing the salvage operation (it always removes the temporary
files before exiting). Other Salvager subprocesses running at the same
time continue until they finish salvaging all other partitions where there is
enough disk space for temporary files. To complete the interrupted
salvage, reissue the command against the appropriate partitions, adding the
B<-tmpdir> argument to redirect the temporary files to a local disk
directory that has enough space.

The -orphans argument controls how the Salvager handles orphaned
files and directories that it finds on server partitions it is
salvaging. An I<orphaned> element is completely inaccessible
because it is not referenced by the vnode of any directory that can act as its
parent (is higher in the filespace). Orphaned objects occupy space on
the server partition, but do not count against the volume's quota.

=head1 CAUTIONS

Running this command can result in data loss if the Salvager process can
repair corruption only by removing the offending data. Consult the
I<IBM AFS Administration Guide> for more information.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -server

Indicates the file server machine on which to salvage volumes.
Identify the machine by IP address or its host name (either fully-qualified or
abbreviated unambiguously). For details, see the introductory reference
page for the B<bos> command suite.

=item -partition

Specifies a single partition on which to salvage all volumes.
Provide the complete partition name (for example B</vicepa>) or one of
the following abbreviated forms:

   B</vicepa>     =     B<vicepa>      =      B<a>      =      0
   B</vicepb>     =     B<vicepb>      =      B<b>      =      1

After /vicepz (for which the index is 25) comes 

   B</vicepaa>    =     B<vicepaa>     =      B<aa>     =      26
   B</vicepab>    =     B<vicepab>     =      B<ab>     =      27

and so on through 

   B</vicepiv>    =     B<vicepiv>     =      B<iv>     =      255

=item -volume

Specifies the name or volume ID number of a read/write volume to
salvage. The B<-partition> argument must be provided along with
this one.

=item -file

Specifies the complete pathname of a file into which to write a trace of
the salvage operation, in addition to the B</usr/afs/logs/SalvageLog>
file on the server machine. If the file pathname is local, the trace is
written to the specified file on the local disk of the machine where the
B<bos salvage> command is issued. If the B<-volume>
argument is included, the file can be in AFS, though not in the volume being
salvaged. Do not combine this argument with the B<-showlog>
flag.

=item -all

Salvages all volumes on all of the partitions on the machine named by the
B<-server> argument.

=item -showlog

Displays the trace of the salvage operation on the standard output stream,
as well as writing it to the B</usr/afs/logs/SalvageLog> file.
Do not combine this flag with the B<-file> argument.

=item -parallel

Specifies the maximum number of Salvager subprocesses to run in
parallel. Provide one of three values:

=over 4

=item *

An integer from the range B<1> to 32. A value of
B<1> means that a single Salvager process salvages the partitions
sequentially.


=item *

The string all to run up to four Salvager subprocesses in
parallel on partitions formatted as logical volumes that span multiple
physical disks. Use this value only with such logical volumes.


=item *

The string all followed immediately (with no intervening space)
by an integer from the range B<1> to B<32>, to run the
specified number of Salvager subprocesses in parallel on partitions formatted
as logical volumes. Use this value only with such logical
volumes.


=back

The BOS Server never starts more Salvager subprocesses than there are
partitions, and always starts only one process to salvage a single
volume. If this argument is omitted, up to four Salvager subprocesses
run in parallel.

=item -tmpdir

Specifies the full pathname of a local disk directory to which the
Salvager process writes temporary files as it runs. If this argument is
omitted, or specifies an ineligible or nonexistent directory, the Salvager
process writes the files to the partition it is currently salvaging.

=item -orphans

Controls how the Salvager handles orphaned files and directories.
Choose one of the following three values:

=over 4

=item ignore

Leaves the orphaned objects on the disk, but prints a message to the
B</usr/afs/logs/SalvageLog> file reporting how many orphans were found
and the approximate number of kilobytes they are consuming. This is the
default if the B<-orphans> argument is omitted.

=item remove

Removes the orphaned objects, and prints a message to the
B</usr/afs/logs/SalvageLog> file reporting how many orphans were
removed and the approximate number of kilobytes they were consuming.

=item attach

Attaches the orphaned objects by creating a reference to them in the vnode
of the volume's root directory. Since each object's actual
name is now lost, the Salvager assigns each one a name of the following
form: 

=over 4


_ _ORPHANFILE_ _.I<index> for files


_ _ORPHANDIR_ _.I<index> for directories

=back

where I<index> is a two-digit number that uniquely identifies each
object. The orphans are charged against the volume's quota and
appear in the output of the B<ls> command issued against the
volume's root directory.

=back

=item -cell
>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see the
introductory B<bos> reference page.

=item -noauth
>

Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the
issuer. Do not combine this flag with the B<-localauth>
flag. For more details, see the introductory B<bos> reference
page.

=item -localauth
>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<bos> command
interpreter presents the ticket to the BOS Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> or
B<-noauth> options. For more details, see the introductory
B<bos> reference page.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command salvages all volumes on the /vicepd
partition of the machine B<db3.abc.com>:

   % bos salvage -server db3.abc.com -partition /vicepd

The following command salvages the volume with volume ID number 536870988
on partition B</vicepb> of the machine
B<fs2.abc.com>:

   % bos salvage -server fs2.abc.com -partition /vicepb -volume 536870988

The following command salvages all volumes on the machine
B<fs4.abc.com>. Six Salvager processes run in
parallel rather than the default four.

   % bos salvage -server fs4.abc.com -all -parallel 6

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the /usr/afs/etc/UserList file on
the machine named by the B<-server> argument, or must be logged onto a
server machine as the local superuser B<root> if the
B<-localauth> flag is included.
