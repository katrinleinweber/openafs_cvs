=head1 NAME

xfs_size_check - Verifies proper inode configuration

=head1 SYNOPSIS

xfs_size_check

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The xfs_size_check command, when run on a file server machine
that runs IRIX version 6.2 or higher and uses XFS-formatted partitions
as server partitions (conventionally mounted at B</vicep>
directories), verifies that each partition uses 512-byte inodes. AFS
stores information in the inodes on server partitions, and the 256-byte inode
size that XFS uses by default is not large enough.

=head1 CAUTIONS

This command is available on in the AFS distribution for IRIX system types
that can use XFS-formatted partitions as server partitions.

=head1 OUTPUT

If all server partitions are properly configured, the command produces no
output. Otherwise, it prints the following header:

   Need to remake the following partitions:

and then the following message for each partition on which to run the IRIX
B<mkfs> command with the indicated options:

   I<device>: mkfs -t xfs -i size=512 -l size=4000b I<device>

where I<device> is in a format like /dev/dsk/dks0d0s0 for
a single disk partition or B</dev/xlv/xlv0> for a logical
volume.
