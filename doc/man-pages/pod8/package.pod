=head1 NAME

package - Configures files and directories on the local disk

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<package> [B<initcmd>]  [-config <I<base name of configuration file>>]
[B<-fullconfig> <I<full name of configuration file, or stdin for standard input>>]
   [B<-overwrite>]  [B<-noaction>]  [B<-verbose>]  [B<-silent>]  [-rebootfiles]  
   [B<-debug>]  [-help]

B<package> [B<i>]  [-c <I<base name of configuration file>>]
[B<-f> <I<full name of configuration file, or stdin for standard input>>]
        [B<-o>]  [B<-n>]  [B<-v>]  [B<-s>]  [B<-r>]  [B<-d>]  [-h]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The package command configures the machine's local disk to
comply with the instructions in the configuration file named by the
B<-config> or B<-fullconfig> argument.

By default, the package command alters any existing local disk
element whose contents or configuration does not match the element defined in
the configuration file. For example, if a configuration file
B<D> instruction defines a directory that has the same name as a
symbolic link on the local disk, the B<package> command replaces the
symbolic link with the directory. The B<F> and B<L>
instructions include an optional I<update_code> field that alters this
behavior.

Also by default, the package command takes no action on elements
on the local disk that are not mentioned in the configuration file. Use
the B<D> instruction's B<R> update code to remove files
from the disk directory that are not mentioned in the configuration
file.

Before running the package command, the administrator must
create the template file and other files on the local disk. For
instructions, see the I<IBM AFS Administration Guide>.

It is not possible to configure a remote client machine's disk using
this command.

=head1 CAUTIONS

The package command interpreter exits without executing any
instruction if there are any syntax errors or incorrect values in the
configuration file.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item initcmd

Accommodates the command's use of the AFS command parser, and is
optional.

=item -config

Specifies the pathname of the configuration file to use, ending in the
file's base name, which omits the suffix that indicates the machine
type. The B<package> command determines the machine's
system type name and automatically appends it to the base name. An
example of the proper value for this argument is B<staff> rather than
B<staff.rs_aix42>. Partial pathnames are interpreted
relative to the current working directory.

Provide this argument or the -fullconfig argument.

=item -fullconfig

Specifies the configuration file to use. Two types of values are
acceptable: 

=over 4

=item *

The full pathname of the configuration file to use, complete with an
extension indicating the machine type (examples:
B<staff.rs_aix42>, B<admin.sun4x_56>).


=item *

The string stdin to indicate that the issuer is providing
configuration information via the standard input stream, either by piping in
the contents of a file, or by typing configuration lines at the shell.
In the latter case, type B<<Ctrl-d>> to conclude the input.


=back

Provide this argument or the -config argument.

=item -overwrite

Overwrites elements on the local disk with the source version indicated in
the configuration file, even if the owner B<write> (B<w>) mode
bit is turned on the disk element. Files protected by the B<I>
update code on an B<F> line in the configuration file are not
overwritten.

=item -noaction

Checks the sequence of operations to be performed when the command
actually runs and reports any problems that the B<package> command
interpreter expects to encounter. No elements on the local disk or in
AFS are changed. If the B<-verbose> flag is also provided, the
trace includes all actions to be performed as well as anticipated
errors.

=item -silent

Suppresses some of the trace messages sent to the standard output stream
by default. The output still reports major problems.

=item -verbose

Produces on the standard output stream a detailed trace of the
command's execution. If this argument is omitted, only warnings
and error messages appear.

=item -rebootfiles

Prevents overwriting of any file marked with the Q update code
on an B<F> line in the configuration file. This effectively
prevents the machine from rebooting automatically again when the
B<package> command is invoked in the machine's AFS initialization
file.

=item -debug

Enables debugging output, which is directed to the standard output stream
by default. By default, no debugging output is produced.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

This command is usually invoked in a client machine's AFS
initialization file (B</etc/rc> or equivalent), rather than issued at
the command shell prompt.

The following command invokes the version of the staff
configuration file appropriate for this machine's system type, and
produces verbose output.

   # /etc/package -c staff -v

The following example uses the configuration file whose basename is defined
in the B</.package> file on the local machine. This
method enables the administrator to use the same B<package> command in
every machine's AFS initialization file but still customize configuration
by putting the appropriate basename in the B</.package>
file.

   # /etc/package -c `cat /.package` -v

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be logged in as the local superuser root.
