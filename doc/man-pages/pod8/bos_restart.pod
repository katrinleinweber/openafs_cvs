=head1 NAME

bos restart - Restarts a server process

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<bos restart -server> <I<machine name>>  [B<-instance> <I<instances>>+]  [-bosserver]  
[B<-all>]  [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>]  [B<-noauth>]  [B<-localauth>]  [B<-help>]

B<bos res -s> <I<machine name>>  [B<-i> <I<instances>>+]  [B<-b>]  [-a]  
[B<-c> <I<cell name>>]  [B<-n>]  [B<-l>]  [B<-h>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The bos restart command stops and immediately restarts server
processes on the server machine named by the B<-server>
argument. Indicate which process or processes to restart by providing
one of the following arguments:

=over 4

=item *

The -instance argument names each AFS server process to stop
and restart immediately, regardless of its status flag in the
B</usr/afs/local/BosConfig> file. Do not include
B<bosserver> in the list of processes; use the
B<-bosserver> flag instead.


=item *

The -bosserver flag stops all AFS server processes running on
the machine, including the BOS Server. A new BOS Server starts
immediately, and it starts a new instance of each process that is marked with
the C<Run> status flag in the B<BosConfig> file.


=item *

The -all flag stops all AFS server processes running on the
machine, except the BOS Server, and immediately restarts the processes that
are marked with the C<Run> status flag in the B<BosConfig>
file.


=back

This command does not change a process's status flag in the
B<BosConfig> file.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -server
>

Indicates the server machine on which to restart each process.
Identify the machine by IP address or its host name (either fully-qualified or
abbreviated unambiguously). For details, see the introductory reference
page for the B<bos> command suite.

=item -instance
>

Names each process to stop and then restart immediately regardless of its
status flag setting. Use the process name assigned with the
B<-instance> argument to the B<bos create> command. The
output from the B<bos status> command lists the names. Provide
this flag or one of the B<-bosserver> or B<-all> options, but
do not combine them.

=item -bosserver
>

Stops all AFS server processes running on the machine, including the BOS
Server. A new BOS Server instance immediately starts, and starts all
processes marked with the C<Run> status flag in the
B<BosConfig> file. Provide this flag or one of the
B<-instance> or B<-all> options, but do not combine
them.

=item -all
>

Stops all AFS server processes running on the machine other than the BOS
Server, and immediately restarts the processes marked with the B<Run>
status flag in the B<BosConfig> file. Provide this flag or one
of the B<-instance> or B<-bosserver> options, but do not
combine them.

=item -cell
>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see the
introductory B<bos> reference page.

=item -noauth
>

Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the

page.

=item -localauth
>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<bos> command
interpreter presents the ticket to the BOS Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> or
B<-noauth> options. For more details, see the introductory
B<bos> reference page.

=item -help
