=head1 NAME

kas listtickets - Displays all of the issuer's tickets (tokens)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<kas listtickets> [B<-name> <I<name of server>>]  [B<-long>]  [-help]

B<kas listt> [B<-n> <I<name of server>>]  [B<-l>]  [-h]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The kas listtickets command displays the associated user ID (AFS
UID), cell name, and expiration date of some or all of the issuer's
tickets (tokens), depending on which options are provided:

=over 4

=item *

To display all tokens, provide neither the -name argument nor
B<-long> flag. The output is similar to that of the
B<tokens> command.


=item *

To display a single token, provide the -name argument to
specify name of the Authentication Database entry for the entity that accepts
the token. All AFS server processes accept tokens sealed with the key
from the B<afs> entry.


=item *

To display in addition the octal numbers that constitute the token and
session key, provide the B<-long> flag.


=back

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -name

Names the Authentication Database entry of the entity (usually a server
process) that accepts the token to display.

=item -long

Displays the octal numbers that constitute the session key and
ticket.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

The output reports the AFS UID of the user who owns the token, the service
(usually, C<afs>) and cell for which it is valid, and its expiration
date, using the following format. If the message does not specify a
cell, the ticket is for the local cell.

   User's (AFS ID I<AFS UID>) tokens for I<service>[@I<cellname>] [Expires I<date>]

If the -long flag is provided, the output also includes the
octal numbers making up the session key and token, along with the key version
number and the number of bytes in the token (if the number of bytes is not 56,
there is an error).

If the marker C<[>> POSTDATED <]> appears instead of an
expiration date, the ticket does not become valid until the indicated
time. (Only internal calls can create a postdated ticket; there is
no standard interface that allows users to do this.)

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following two examples are for a user with AFS UID 1020 in the
B<abc.com> cell and AFS UID 35 in the
B<test.abc.com> cell. He is working on a machine
in the first cell and is authenticated in both cells.

   % kas listtickets
   User's (AFS ID 1020) tokens for afs [Expires Wed Mar 31 9:30:54 1999]
   User's (AFS ID 35@test.abc.com) tokens for afs@test.abc.com  \
             [Expires Wed Mar 31 13:54:26 1999]

   % kas listtickets -name afs -long
   User's (AFS ID 1020) tokens for afs [Expires Wed Mar 31 9:30:54 1999]
   SessionKey: \375\205\351\227\032\310\263\013
   Ticket: (kvno = 0, len = 56): \033\005\221\156\203\278\312\058\016\133 I<(etc.)>
