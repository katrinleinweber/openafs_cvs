=head1 NAME

uss delete - Deletes a user account

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<uss delete -user> <I<login name>>  [-mountpoint <I<mountpoint for user's volume>>] 
[B<-savevolume>]  [B<-verbose>]  [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>]  
           [B<-admin> <I<administrator to authenticate>>]  [-dryrun]  
           [B<-skipauth>]  [-help]

B<uss d -u> <I<login name>>  [B<-m> <I<mountpoint for user's volume>>]  [B<-sa>]  [-v]
[B<-c> <I<cell name>>]  B<-a> <I<administrator to authenticate>>]  
      [B<-d>]  [B<-sk>]  [-h]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The uss delete command removes the Authentication Database and
Protection Database entries for the user named by B<-user>
argument. In addition, it can remove the user's home volume and
associated VLDB entry, a mount point for the volume or both, depending on
whether the B<-mountpoint> and B<-savevolume> options are
provided.

=over 4

=item *

To remove both the volume and mount point, use the -mountpoint
argument to name the user's home directory. It is best to create a
tape backup of a volume before deleting it. Note that other mount
points for the volume are not removed, if they exist.


=item *

To remove the mount point only, provide both the -mountpoint
and B<-savevolume> options.


=item *

To preserve both the volume and mount point, omit the
B<-mountpoint> argument (or both it and the B<-savevolume>
flag).

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -user

Names the entry to delete from the Protection and Authentication
Databases.

=item -mountpoint

Specifies the pathname to the user's home directory, which is deleted
from the filespace. By default, the volume referenced by the mount
point is also removed from the file server machine that houses it, along with
its Volume Location Database (VLDB) entry. To retain the volume and
VLDB entry, include the B<-savevolume> flag. Partial pathnames
are interpreted relative to the current working directory. 

Specify the read/write path to the mount point, to avoid the failure that
results from attempting to remove a mount point from a read-only
volume. By convention, the read/write path is indicated by placing a
period before the cell name at the pathname's second level (for example,
B</afs/.abc.com>). For further discussion of the
concept of read/write and read-only paths through the filespace, see the
B<fs mkmount> reference page.

=item -savevolume

Preserves the user's volume and VLDB entry.

=item -verbose

Produces on the standard output stream a detailed trace of the
command's execution. If this argument is omitted, only warnings
and error messages appear.

=item -cell

Specifies the cell in which to run the command. For more details,
see the introductory B<uss> reference page.

=item -admin

Specifies the AFS user name under which to establish authenticated
connections to the AFS server processes that maintain the various components
of a user account. For more details, see the introductory
B<uss> reference page.

=item -dryrun

Reports actions that the command interpreter needs to perform while
executing the command, without actually performing them. For more
details, see the introductory B<uss> reference page.

=item -skipauth

Prevents authentication with the AFS Authentication Server, allowing a
site using Kerberos to substitute that form of authentication.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command removes smith's user account from the
B<abc.com> cell. The B<-savevolume> argument
retains the C<user.smith> volume on its file server
machine.

   % uss delete smith -mountpoint /afs/abc.com/usr/smith -savevolume

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer (or the user named by -admin argument) must belong to
the B<system:administrators> group in the Protection Database,
must have the C<ADMIN> flag turned on in his or her Authentication
Database entry, and must have at least B<a> (B<administer>)
and B<d> (B<delete>) permissions on the access control list
(ACL) of the mount point's parent directory. If the
B<-savevolume> flag is not included, the issuer must also be listed in
the B</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file.
