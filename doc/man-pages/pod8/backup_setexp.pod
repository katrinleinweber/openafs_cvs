=head1 NAME

backup setexp - Sets the expiration date for existing dump levels.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<backup setexp -dump> <I<dump level name>>+  [-expires <I<expiration date>>+]
[B<-localauth>]  [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>]  [B<-help>]

B<backup se -d> <I<dump level name>>+  [-e <I<expiration date>>+]
[B<-l>]  [B<-c> <I<cell name>>]  [B<-h>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The backup setexp command sets or changes the expiration date
associated with each specified dump level, which must already exist in the
dump hierarchy.

Use the -expires argument to associate an expiration date with
each dump level. When the Backup System subsequently creates a dump at
the dump level, it uses the specified value to derive the dump's
expiration date, which it records on the label of the tape (or backup data
file). The Backup System refuses to overwrite a tape until after the
latest expiration date of any dump that the tape contains, unless the
B<backup labeltape> command is used to relabel the tape. If a
dump level does not have an expiration date, the Backup System treats dumps
created at the level as expired as soon as it creates them.

(Note that the Backup System does not automatically remove a dump's
record from the Backup Database when the dump reaches its expiration date, but
only if the tape that contains the dump is recycled or relabeled. To
remove expired and other obsolete dump records, use the B<backup
deletedump> command.)

Define either an absolute or relative expiration date:

=over 4

=item *

An absolute expiration date defines the month/day/year (and, optionally,
hour and minutes) at which a dump expires. If the expiration date
predates the dump creation time, the Backup System immediately treats the dump
as expired.


=item *

A relative date defines the number of years, months, or days (or a
combination of the three) after the dump's creation that it
expires. When the Backup System creates a dump at the dump level, it
calculates an actual expiration date by adding the relative date to the start
time of the dump operation.


=back

If the command is used to change an existing expiration date associated
with a dump level, the new date applies only to dumps created after the
change. Existing dumps retain the expiration date assigned at the time
they were created.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -dump

Specifies the full pathname of each dump level to assign the expiration
date specified by the B<-expires> argument.

=item -expires

Defines the absolute or relative expiration date to associate with each
dump level named by the B<-dump> argument. Absolute expiration
dates have the following format:

   [B<at>] {B<NEVER> | I<mm>B</>I<dd>B</>I<yyyy> [I<hh>:I<MM>] }

where the optional word at is followed either by the string
B<NEVER>, which indicates that dumps created at the dump level never
expire, or by a date value with a required portion (I<mm> for month,
I<dd> for day, and I<yyyy> for year) and an optional portion
(I<hh> for hours and I<MM> for minutes). 

Omit the I<hh>:I<MM> portion to use the default of
midnight (00:00 hours), or provide a value in 24-hour format (for
example, B<20:30> is 8:30 p.m.).
Valid values for the year range from B<1970> to B<2037>;
higher values are not valid because the latest possible date in the standard
UNIX representation is in February 2038. The command interpreter
automatically reduces later dates to the maximum value.

Relative expiration dates have the following format: 

   [B<in>] [I<years>B<y>] [I<months>B<m>] [I<days>d]

where the optional word in is followed by at least one of a
number of years (maximum B<9999>) followed by the letter B<y>,
a number of months (maximum B<12>) followed by the letter
B<m>, or a number of days (maximum B<31>) followed by the
letter B<d>. If providing more than one of the three, list them
in the indicated order. If the date that results from adding the
relative expiration value to a dump's creation time is later than the
latest possible date in the UNIX time representation, the Backup System
automatically reduces it to that date. 

=item -localauth

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<backup> command
interpreter presents it to the Backup Server, Volume Server and VL Server
during mutual authentication. Do not combine this flag with the
B<-cell> argument. For more details, see the introductory
B<backup> reference page.

=item -cell

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see the
introductory B<backup> reference page.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example associates an absolute expiration date of 10:00
p.m. on 31 December 1999 with the dump level
B</1998/december>:

   % backup setexp -dump /1998/december -expires at 12/31/1999 22:00

The following example associates a relative expiration date of 7 days with
the two dump levels B</monthly/week1> and
B</monthly/week2>:

   % backup setexp -dump /monthly/week1 /monthly/week -expires 7d

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the /usr/afs/etc/UserList file on
every machine where the Backup Server is running, or must be logged onto a
server machine as the local superuser B<root> if the
B<-localauth> flag is included.
