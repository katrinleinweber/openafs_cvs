=head1 NAME

backup interactive - Enters interactive mode

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<backup> [B<interactive>]  [B<-localauth>]  [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>]  [-help]

B<backup> [B<i>]  [B<-l>]  [B<-c> <I<cell name>>]  [-h]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The backup interactive initiates an interactive session for
issuing B<backup> commands. As indicated in the syntax
statement, the operation code (B<interactive>) is optional.

Several features of interactive mode distinguish it from regular
mode:

=over 4

=item *

In interactive mode, the C<backup>> prompt replaces the system
(shell) prompt. The operator enters only a command's operation
code (omitting the command suite name, B<backup>).


=item *

If the B<-localauth> flag or the -cell argument is
included on the B<backup (interactive)> command, the settings apply to
all commands issued during that interactive session. The issuer does
not need to type them on every command. Another consequence is that the
flag and argument do not appear in the syntax statement generated by the
B<help> subcommand or B<-help> flag on an individual command
issued at the C<backup>> prompt.


=item *

The B<(backup) jobs> and (backup) kill commands are
available only in interactive mode. It is not possible to track and
terminate backup operations as cleanly in non-interactive mode.


=item *

It is not necessary to enclose strings that include metacharacters in
double quotes or other delimiters.


=item *

The backup command interpreter establishes a connection to the
Backup Server, Volume Server and Volume Location (VL) Server processes as it
enters interactive mode, and uses the same connection for all commands during
the session. Execution time can therefore be faster than in
non-interactive mode, in which the command interpreter must establish a new
connection for each command.


=back

To exit an interactive session, issue the (backup) quit
command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -localauth

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<backup> command
interpreter presents it to the Backup Server, Volume Server and VL Server
during mutual authentication. Do not combine this flag with the
B<-cell> argument. For more details, see the introductory
B<backup> reference page.

=item -cell

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see the
introductory B<backup> reference page.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example shows how the -localauth flag and
B<-cell> argument do not appear when the B<help dump>
subcommand is issued in interactive mode.

   % backup
   backup> help dump
   dump: start dump 
   Usage: dump [-volumeset <volume set name>] [-dump <dump level name>] 
   [-portoffset <TC port offset>] [-at <Date/time to start dump>+]
   [-append ] [-n ] [-file <load file>] [-help ] 

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

None. However, backup commands that require privilege in
regular mode still require it in interactive mode.
