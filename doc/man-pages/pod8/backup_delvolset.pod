=head1 NAME

backup delvolset - Deletes one or more volume sets from the Backup Database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

backup delvolset -name <I<volume set name>>+
[B<-localauth>]  [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>]  [B<-help>]

B<backup delvols -n> <I<volume set name>>+  [B<-l>]  [B<-c> <I<cell name>>]  [-h]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The backup delvolset command deletes each volume set named by
the B<-name> argument, and the volume entries each contains, from the
Backup Database. The B<backup listvolsets> command lists the
volume sets (and their volume entries) currently defined in the Backup
Database.

=head1 CAUTIONS

Deleting a temporary volume set is possible only within the interactive
session in which it was created. Exiting the interactive session also
destroys the temporary volume set automatically.

during mutual authentication. Do not combine this flag with the
B<-cell> argument. For more details, see the introductory
B<backup> reference page.

=item -cell

argument with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see the

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the /usr/afs/etc/UserList file on
every machine where the Backup Server is running, or must be logged onto a
server machine as the local superuser B<root> if the
