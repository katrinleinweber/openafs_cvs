=head1 NAME

bos getdate - Displays the time stamps on an AFS binary file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<bos getdate -server> <I<machine name>>  -file <I<files to check>>+
[B<-dir> <I<destination dir>>]  [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>]
            [B<-noauth>]  [B<-localauth>]  [-help]

B<bos getd -s> <I<machine name>>  B<-f> <I<files to check>>+  [-d <I<destination dir>>]
[B<-c> <I<cell name>>]  [B<-n>]  [B<-l>]  [B<-h>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The bos getdate command displays the time stamps on the current
version,C< .BAK> version (if any) and C<.OLD>
version (if any) of each binary file named by the B<-file>
argument. (The BOS Server automatically creates C<.BAK>
and C<.OLD> versions when new binaries are installed with the
B<bos install> command.) The files must reside in the
B</usr/afs/bin> directory on the server machine named by the
B<-server> argument unless the B<-dir> argument indicates an
alternate directory.

To revert to the C<.BAK> version of a binary, use the
B<bos uninstall> command. To remove obsolete binary files from
the B</usr/afs/bin> directory, use the B<bos prune>
command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -server
>

Indicates the server machine from which to list binary files.
Identify the machine by IP address or its host name (either fully-qualified or
abbreviated unambiguously). For details, see the introductory reference
page for the B<bos> command suite. 

All server machines of the same AFS system type show the same timestamps if
the binaries were installed properly on the binary distribution machine for
this machine's system type, and if all other machines of that type are
running the appropriate B<upclientbin> process.

=item -file
>

Names each binary file to list.

=item -dir
>

Specifies the complete pathname of the local disk directory containing
each file named by the B<-file> argument. It is necessary only
if the files are not in the B</usr/afs/bin> directory.

=item -cell
>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see the
introductory B<bos> reference page.

=item -noauth
>

Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the
issuer. Do not combine this flag with the B<-localauth>
flag. For more details, see the introductory B<bos> reference
page.

=item -localauth
>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<bos> command
interpreter presents the ticket to the BOS Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> or
B<-noauth> options. For more details, see the introductory
B<bos> reference page.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

For each file specified with the -file argument, the output
displays the time stamp on the current (unmarked), C<.BAK>, and
C<.OLD> version. The output explicitly reports that a
version does not exist, rather than simply omitting it.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command examines the time stamps on the files with basename
B<kaserver> on the machine B<fs2.abc.com>:

   % bos getdate -server fs2.abc.com -file kaserver
   File /usr/afs/bin/kaserver dated Mon Jan 4 10:00:36 1999.
   .BAK file dated Wed Dec 9 18:55:04 1998, no .OLD file.
