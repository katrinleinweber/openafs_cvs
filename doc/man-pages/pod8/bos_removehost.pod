=head1 NAME

bos removehost - Removes a database server machine from the
B</usr/afs/etc/CellServDB> file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<bos removehost -server> <I<machine name>>  -host <I<host name>>+ 
[B<-cell> <I<cell name>>]  [B<-noauth>]  [B<-localauth>]  [B<-help>]

B<bos removeh -s> <I<machine name>>  B<-ho> <I<host name>>+  [-c <I<cell name>>]  
[B<-n>]  [B<-l>]  [B<-he>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The bos removehost command removes the entry for each database
server machine specified with the B<-host> argument from the
B</usr/afs/etc/CellServDB> file on the server machine named by the
B<-server> argument.

=head1 CAUTIONS

After executing this command (and waiting for the Update Server to
propagate the changes, if it is used), restart the database server processes
on all database server machines to force election of a quorum that includes
the new set of machines listed in the B</usr/afs/etc/CellServDB>
file. The I<IBM AFS Quick Beginnings> explains in more detail
how to add and remove database server machines.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -server
>

Indicates the server machine on which to change the
B</usr/afs/etc/CellServDB> file. Identify the machine by IP
address or its host name (either fully-qualified or abbreviated
unambiguously). For details, see the introductory reference page for
the B<bos> command suite. 

In cells that run the United States edition of AFS and use the Update
Server to distribute the contents of the B</usr/afs/etc> directory, it
is conventional to specify only the system control machine as a value for the
B<-server> argument. In cells that run the international
version of AFS, repeat the command for each file server machine. For
further discussion, see the introductory reference page for the B<bos>
command suite.

=item -host
>

Specifies the fully-qualified host name (such as
B<fs2.abc.com>) of each database server machine to
remove from the B<CellServDB> file.

=item -cell
>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see the
introductory B<bos> reference page.

=item -noauth
>

Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the
issuer. Do not combine this flag with the B<-localauth>
flag. For more details, see the introductory B<bos> reference
page.

=item -localauth
>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<bos> command
interpreter presents the ticket to the BOS Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> or
B<-noauth> options. For more details, see the introductory
B<bos> reference page.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command removes the former database server machine
B<db2.abc.com> from the B<CellServDB> file on
the system control machine B<fs1.abc.com>.

   % bos removehost -server fs1.abc.com -host db2.abc.com

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the /usr/afs/etc/UserList file on
the machine named by the B<-server> argument, or must be logged onto a
server machine as the local superuser B<root> if the
B<-localauth> flag is included.
