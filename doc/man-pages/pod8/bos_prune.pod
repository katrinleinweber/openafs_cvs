=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<bos prune -server> <I<machine name>>  [B<-bak>]  [B<-old>]  [B<-core>]  [-all]
[B<-cell> <I<cell name>>]  [B<-noauth>]  [B<-localauth>]  [B<-help>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The bos prune command removes files from the local disk of the
server machine named by the B<-server> argument, as specified by one
or more of the following flags provided on the command line:

=over 4

=item *

The -bak flag removes all files from the
B</usr/afs/bin> directory that have a C<.BAK>
extension.


=item *

The -old flag removes all files from the
B</usr/afs/bin> directory that have a C<.OLD>
extension.


=item *

The -core flag removes all files from the
B</usr/afs/logs> directory that have a C<core.>
prefix.


=item *

The -all flag removes all three types of files at once.


=back

(If none of these flags are included, the command appears to succeed, but
removes no files at all.)

To display the timestamp on the current, C<.BAK>, and
C<.OLD> versions of one or more files, use the B<bos
getdate> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -server
>

Indicates the server machine from which to remove files. Identify
the machine by IP address or its host name (either fully-qualified or
abbreviated unambiguously). For details, see the introductory reference
page for the B<bos> command suite.

=item -bak
>

Removes all files from the /usr/afs/bin directory that have a
C<.BAK> extension. Do not combine this flag and the
B<-all> flag.

=item -old
>

Removes all files from the /usr/afs/bin directory that have a
C<.OLD> extension. Do not combine this flag and the
B<-all> flag.

=item -core
>

Removes all files from the /usr/afs/logs directory that have a
C<core.> prefix. Do not combine this flag and the
B<-all> flag.

=item -all
>

Combines the effect of the B<-bak>, -old, and
B<-core> flags. Do not combine this flag with any of those
three.

=item -cell

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see the

flag. For more details, see the introductory B<bos> reference
page.

=item -localauth
>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<bos> command
interpreter presents the ticket to the BOS Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> or
B<-noauth> options. For more details, see the introductory
B<bos> reference page.
