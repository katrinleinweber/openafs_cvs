kaserver - Initializes the Authentication Server

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<kaserver> [B<-noAuth>]  [B<-fastKeys>]  [-database <I<dbpath>>] 
[B<-localfiles> <I<lclpath>>]  [B<-minhours> <I<n>>] 
         [B<-servers> <I<serverlist>>]  [-enable_peer_stats]  
         [B<-enable_process_stats>]  [-help]

This command does not use the syntax conventions of the AFS command
suites. Provide the command name and all option names in full.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The kaserver command initializes the Authentication Server,
which runs on every database server machine. In the conventional
configuration, its binary file is located in the B</usr/afs/bin>
directory on a file server machine.

The kaserver command is not normally issued at the command shell
prompt but rather placed into a file server machine's
B</usr/afs/local/BosConfig> file with the B<bos create>
command. If it is ever issued at the command shell prompt, the issuer
must be logged onto a database server machine as the local superuser
B<root>.

As it initializes, the Authentication Server process creates the two files
that constitute the Authentication Database, B<kaserver.DB0>
and B<kaserver.DBSYS1>, in the B</usr/afs/db> directory
if they do not already exist. Use the commands in the B<kas>
suite to administer the database.

The Authentication Server is responsible for several aspects of AFS
security, including:

=over 4

=item *

Maintenance of all AFS server encryption keys and user passwords in the
Authentication Database.


=item *

Creation of the tickets and tokens that users and servers use to establish
secure connections. Its Ticket Granting Service (TGS) component
performs this function.


=back

The Authentication Server records a trace of its activity in the
B</usr/afs/logs/AuthLog> file. Use the B<bos getlog>
command to display the contents of the file. Use the B<kdb>
command to read the protected files associated with the B<AuthLog>
file, B<AuthLog.dir> and B<AuthLog.pag>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -noAuth

Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the
issuer. Thus, it establishes an unauthenticated connection between the
issuer and the Authentication Server. It is useful only when
authorization checking is disabled on the database server machine. In
normal circumstances, the Authentication Server allows only authorized
(privileged) users to issue commands that affect or contact the Authentication
Database and will refuse to perform such an action even if the
B<-noAuth> flag is used.

=item -fastKeys

Is a test flag for use by the AFS Development staff; it serves no
functional purpose.

=item -database

Specifies the pathname of an alternate directory in which the
Authentication Database files reside. Provide the complete pathname,
ending in the base filename to which the B<.DB0> and
B<.DBSYS1> extensions are appended. For example, the
appropriate value for the default database files is
B</usr/afs/db/kaserver>.

Provide the -localfiles argument along with this one;
otherwise, the B<-localfiles> argument is also set to the value of
this argument, which is probably inappropriate.

=item -localfiles

Specifies the pathname of an alternate directory in which the auxiliary
Authentication Database file resides. Provide the complete pathname,
ending in the base filename to which the B<auxdb> suffix is
appended. For example, the appropriate value for the default auxiliary
database file is B</usr/afs/local/kaserver>.

=item -minhours

Specifies the minimum number of hours that must pass between password
changes made by any regular user. System administrators (with the
C<ADMIN> flag in their Authentication Database entry) can change
passwords as often as desired. Setting a minimum time between password
changes is not recommended.

=item -servers

Names each database server machine running an Authentication Server with
which the local Authentication Server is to synchronize its copy of the
Authentication Database , rather than with the machines listed in the local
B</usr/afs/etc/CellServDB> file.

=item -enable_peer_stats

Activates the collection of Rx statistics and allocates memory for their
storage. For each connection with a specific UDP port on another
machine, a separate record is kept for each type of RPC (FetchFile, GetStatus,
and so on) sent or received. To display or otherwise access the
records, use the Rx Monitoring API.

=item -enable_process_stats

Activates the collection of Rx statistics and allocates memory for their
storage. A separate record is kept for each type of RPC (FetchFile,
GetStatus, and so on) sent or received, aggregated over all connections to
other machines. To display or otherwise access the records, use the Rx
Monitoring API.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following B<bos create> command creates a kaserver
process on B<fs3.abc.com> (the command appears on two
lines here only for legibility):

   % bos create -server fs3.abc.com -instance kaserver \
                -type simple -cmd /usr/afs/bin/kaserver

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be logged in as the superuser root on a file
server machine to issue the command at a command shell prompt. It is
conventional instead to create and start the process by issuing the B<bos
create> command.
