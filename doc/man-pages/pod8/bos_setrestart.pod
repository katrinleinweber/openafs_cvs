=head1 NAME

bos setrestart - Sets the date and time at which the BOS Server restarts processes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<bos setrestart -server> <I<machine name>>  -time <I<time to restart server>>  
[B<-general>]   [B<-newbinary>]  [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>]  
               [B<-noauth>]  [B<-localauth>]  [-help]  

B<bos setr -s> <I<machine name>>  B<-t> <I<time to restart server>>  [B<-g>]  [-ne] 
[B<-c> <I<cell name>>]  [B<-no>]  [B<-l>]  [B<-h>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The bos setrestart command records in the
B</usr/afs/local/BosConfig> file the times at which the BOS Server
running on the server machine named by the B<-server> argument
performs two types of restarts:

=over 4

=item *

A I<general restart>. By default, once per week the BOS
Server restarts itself and then any AFS process marked with the C<Run>
status flag in the B<BosConfig> file (equivalent in effect to issuing
the B<bos restart> command with the B<-bosserver>
flag). The default setting is 4:00 a.m. each Sunday
morning.


=item *

A I<binary restart>. By default, once per day the BOS
Server restarts any currently running process for which the timestamp on the
binary file in the B</usr/afs/bin> directory is later than the time
the process last started or restarted. The default is 5:00
a.m. each day.


=back

=head1 CAUTIONS

Restarting a process makes it unavailable for a period of time. The
B<fs> process has potentially the longest outage, depending on how
many volumes the file server machine houses (the File Server and Volume Server
reattach each volume when they restart). The default settings are
designed to coincide with periods of low usage, so that the restarts disturb
the smallest possible number of users.

If the setting specified with the -time argument is within one
hour of the current time, the BOS Server does not restart any processes until
the next applicable opportunity (the next day for binary restarts, or the next
week for general restarts).

The command changes only one type of restart setting at a time; issue
the command twice to change both settings.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -server

Indicates the server machine on which to set a new restart time.
Identify the machine by IP address or its host name (either fully-qualified or
abbreviated unambiguously). For details, see the introductory reference
page for the B<bos> command suite.

=item -time

Specifies the restart time. By convention the general restart is
defined as weekly (specifies both a day and a time), and the binary restart is
defined as daily (specifies only a time). However, it is acceptable to
define a daily general restart or weekly binary restart.

There are four acceptable values for either type of restart setting: 

=over 4

=item *

The string never, which directs the BOS Server never to perform
the indicated type of restart.


=item *

The string now, which directs the BOS Server to perform the
restart immediately and never again.


=item *

A time of day (the conventional type of value for the binary restart
time). Separate the hours and minutes with a colon
(I<hh>:I<MM>), and use either 24-hour format, or a value
in the range from B<1:00> through B<12:59> with
the addition of B<am> or B<pm>. For example, both
B<14:30> and B<"2:30 pm"> indicate 2:30 in
the afternoon. Surround this parameter with double quotes (B<"
">) if it contains a space.


=item *

A day of the week and time of day, separated by a space and surrounded
with double quotes (B<" ">). This is the conventional type of
value for the general restart. For the day, provide either the whole
name or the first three letters, all in lowercase letters (B<sunday>
or B<sun>, B<thursday> or B<thu>, and so on).
For the time, use the same format as when specifying the time alone.


=back

If desired, precede a time or day and time definition with the string
B<every> or B<at>. These words do not change the
meaning, but possibly make the output of the B<bos getrestart> command
easier to understand.

=item -general
>

Sets the general restart time.

=item -newbinary
>

Sets the binary restart time.

=item -cell
>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see the
introductory B<bos> reference page.

=item -noauth
>

Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the
issuer. Do not combine this flag with the B<-localauth>
flag. For more details, see the introductory B<bos> reference
page.

=item -localauth
>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<bos> command
interpreter presents the ticket to the BOS Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> or
B<-noauth> options. For more details, see the introductory
B<bos> reference page.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command sets the general restart time on the machine
B<fs4.abc.com> to Saturday at 3:30 am.

   % bos setrestart -server fs4.abc.com -time "sat 3:30" -general

The following command sets the binary restart time on the machine
B<fs6.abc.com> to 11:45 pm.

   % bos setrestart -server fs6.abc.com -time 23:45 -newbinary

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the /usr/afs/etc/UserList file on
the machine named by the B<-server> argument, or must be logged onto a
server machine as the local superuser B<root> if the
B<-localauth> flag is included.
