=head1 NAME

kas statistics - Displays statistics from an Authentication Server process

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<kas statistics> [-admin_username <I<admin principal to use for authentication>>]
[B<-password_for_admin> <I<admin password>>]  [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>] 
               [-servers <I<explicit list of authentication servers>>+]
               [B<-noauth>]  [-help]

B<kas sta> [-a <I<admin principal to use for authentication>>]  
[B<-p> <I<admin password>>]  [B<-c> <I<cell name>>]  
        [B<-s> <I<explicit list of authentication servers>>+]  [B<-n>]  [-h]  

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The kas statistics command displays statistics from the
Authentication Server running on one of the cell's database server
machines. Use the B<-servers> argument to name a specific
machine, or the command interpreter chooses one at random from all the
database server machines with which it has established connections.

=head1 CAVEATS

The -servers argument is not available in interactive mode,
making it impossible to specify a certain machine.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -admin_username

Specifies the user identity under which to authenticate with the
Authentication Server for execution of the command. For more details,
see the introductory B<kas> reference page.

=item -password_for_admin

Specifies the password of the command's issuer. If it is
omitted (as recommended), the B<kas> command interpreter prompts for
it and does not echo it visibly. For more details, see the introductory
B<kas> reference page.

=item -cell

Names the cell in which to run the command. For more details, see
the introductory B<kas> reference page.

=item -servers

Names each machine running an Authentication Server with which to
establish a connection. For more details, see the introductory
B<kas> reference page.

=item -noauth

Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the
issuer. For more details, see the introductory B<kas> reference
page.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options

=item *

The server machine's IP address in hexadecimal and the date when the
current instance of the Authentication Server started.


=item *

The number of requests and aborted requests for various services:
authentication, ticket granting, password setting, entry listing, and so
on.

=head1 EXAMPLES

In the following example, an administrator using the admin
account gathers statistics from the Authentication Server running on the
machine B<fs1.abc.com>.

   % kas statistics -servers fs1.abc.com
   56 allocs, 46 frees, 0 password changes
   Hash table utilization = 0.100000%
   From host bfff21a7 started at Tue Mar 23 12:42:02 1999:
     of 88 requests for Authenticate, 18 were aborted.
