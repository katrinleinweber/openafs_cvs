=head1 NAME

prdb_check - Checks the integrity of the Protection Database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<prdb_check -database> <I<ptdb_file>>  [B<-uheader>]  [B<-pheader>]  [-entries]  
[B<-verbose>]  [B<-help>]

B<prdb_check -d> <I<ptdb_file>>  [B<-u>]  [B<-p>]  [B<-e>]  [B<-v>]  [-h]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The prdb_check command checks the integrity of the Protection
Database, reporting any errors or corruption it finds. If there are
problems, do not issue any B<pts> commands until the database is
repaired.

=head1 CAVEATS

The results can be unpredictable if the Protection Server makes changes to
the Protection Database while this command is running. Use the B<bos
shutdown> command to shutdown the local B<ptserver> process
before running this command, or before creating a second copy of the
B<prdb.DB0> file (with a different name) on which to run the
command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -database

Names the Protection Database (copy of the prdb.DB0
file) to check. If the current working directory is not the location of
the file, provide a pathname, either full or relative to the current working
directory.

=item -uheader

Displays information which Ubik maintains in the database's
header.

=item -pheader

Displays information which the Protection Server maintains in the
database's header.

=item -entries

Outputs every entry in the database. Some of the information is
similar to that returned by the B<pts examine> command.

=item -verbose

Reports additional information about the database, including the number of
entries in the database and a trace of the internal database structures the
command is verifying.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

If there are errors in the database, the output always reports them on the
standard error stream. If any options other than B<-database>
or B<-help> are provided, the output written to the standard output
stream includes additional information as described for each option in the
preceding B<Options> section of this reference page. The output
is intended for debugging purposes and is meaningful to someone familiar with
the internal structure of the Protection Database.

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be logged in as the local superuser root.
