=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<ptserver> command initializes the Protection Server, which must run
on every database server machine. In the conventional configuration, its
binary file is located in the F</usr/afs/bin> directory on a file server
machine.

The ptserver command is not normally issued at the command shell prompt,
but rather placed into a database server machine's
F</usr/afs/local/BosConfig> file with the B<bos create> command. If it is
ever issued at the command shell prompt, the issuer must be logged onto a
file server machine as the local superuser C<root>.

The Protection Server performs the following tasks:

=over 4

=item *

Maintains the Protection Database, which contains entries for every user
and group in the cell. Use the B<pts> commands to administer the database.

=item *

Allocates AFS IDs for new user, machine and group entries and maps each ID
to the corresponding name.

=item *

Generates a current protection subgroup (CPS) at the File Server's
request. The CPS lists all groups to which a user or machine belongs.

=back

This command does not use the syntax conventions of the AFS command
suites. Provide the command name and all option names in full.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-database> <I<db path>>

Specifies the pathname of an alternate directory in which the Protection
Database files reside. Provide the complete pathname, ending in the base
filename to which the C<.DB0> and C<.DBSYS1> extensions are appended. For
example, the appropriate value for the default database files is
F</usr/afs/db/prdb>.

=item B<-p> <I<number of processes>>

Sets the number of server lightweight processes (LWPs) to run.  Provide a
positive integer from the range C<3> to C<16>. The default value is C<3>.

=item B<-rebuildDB>

Rebuilds the Protection Database at the beginning of Protection Server
initialization. Use this argument only in consultation with AFS
Development or Product Support.

=item B<-enable_peer_stats>

Activates the collection of Rx statistics and allocates memory for their
storage. For each connection with a specific UDP port on another machine,
a separate record is kept for each type of RPC (FetchFile, GetStatus, and
so on) sent or received. To display or otherwise access the records, use
the Rx Monitoring API.

=item B<-enable_process_stats>

Activates the collection of Rx statistics and allocates memory for their
storage. A separate record is kept for each type of RPC (FetchFile,
GetStatus, and so on) sent or received, aggregated over all connections to
other machines. To display or otherwise access the records, use the Rx
Monitoring API.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following B<bos create> command creates a C<ptserver> process on the
machine C<fs3.abc.com>. The command appears here on multiple lines only
for legibility.

   % bos create -server fs3.abc.com -instance ptserver \
                -type simple -cmd /usr/afs/bin/ptserver

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be logged in as the superuser C<root> on a file server
machine to issue the command at a command shell prompt. It is conventional
instead to create and start the process by issuing the B<bos create>
command.
