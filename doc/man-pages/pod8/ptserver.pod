=head1 NAME

ptserver - Initializes the Protection Server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ptserver> [B<-database> <I<db path>>]  [B<-p> <I<number of processes>>] [-rebuildDB] 
[B<-enable_peer_stats>]  [B<-enable_process_stats>]  [B<-help>]

This command does not use the syntax conventions of the AFS command
suites. Provide the command name and all option names in full.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ptserver command initializes the Protection Server, which
must run on every database server machine. In the conventional
configuration, its binary file is located in the B</usr/afs/bin>
directory on a file server machine.

The ptserver command is not normally issued at the command shell
prompt, but rather placed into a database server machine's
B</usr/afs/local/BosConfig> file with the B<bos create>
command. If it is ever issued at the command shell prompt, the issuer
must be logged onto a file server machine as the local superuser
B<root>.

The Protection Server performs the following tasks:

=over 4

=item *

Maintains the Protection Database, which contains entries for every user
and group in the cell. Use the B<pts> commands to administer
the database.


=item *

Allocates AFS IDs for new user, machine and group entries and maps each ID
to the corresponding name.


=item *

Generates a current protection subgroup (CPS) at the File Server's
request. The CPS lists all groups to which a user or machine
belongs.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -database

Specifies the pathname of an alternate directory in which the Protection
Database files reside. Provide the complete pathname, ending in the
base filename to which the B<.DB0> and
B<.DBSYS1> extensions are appended. For example, the
appropriate value for the default database files is
B</usr/afs/db/prdb>.

=item -p

Sets the number of server lightweight processes (LWPs) to run.
Provide a positive integer from the range B<3> to
B<16>. The default value is 3.

=item -rebuildDB

Rebuilds the Protection Database at the beginning of Protection Server
initialization. Use this argument only in consultation with AFS
Development or Product Support.

=item -enable_peer_stats

Activates the collection of Rx statistics and allocates memory for their
storage. For each connection with a specific UDP port on another
machine, a separate record is kept for each type of RPC (FetchFile, GetStatus,
and so on) sent or received. To display or otherwise access the
records, use the Rx Monitoring API.

=item -enable_process_stats

Activates the collection of Rx statistics and allocates memory for their
storage. A separate record is kept for each type of RPC (FetchFile,
GetStatus, and so on) sent or received, aggregated over all connections to
other machines. To display or otherwise access the records, use the Rx
Monitoring API.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following B<bos create> command creates a ptserver
process on the machine B<fs3.abc.com>. The
command appears here on multiple lines only for legibility.

   % bos create -server fs3.abc.com -instance ptserver  \
                -type simple -cmd /usr/afs/bin/ptserver

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be logged in as the superuser root on a file
server machine to issue the command at a command shell prompt. It is
conventional instead to create and start the process by issuing the B<bos
create> command.
