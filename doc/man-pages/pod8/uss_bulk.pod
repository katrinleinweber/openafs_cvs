=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<uss bulk -file> <I<bulk input file>>  [-template <I<pathname of template file>>]
[B<-verbose>]  [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>]  
         [B<-admin> <I<administrator to authenticate>>] [-dryrun]  
         [B<-skipauth>]  [-overwrite]
         [-pwexpires <I<password expires in [0..254] days (0 => never)>>]  
         [B<-pipe>]  [-help]

B<uss b -f> <I<bulk input file>>  [B<-t> <I<pathname of template file>>]  [-v]  
[B<-c> <I<cell name>>]  [B<-a> <I<administrator to authenticate>>]  [B<-d>]  [B<-s>]  
      [B<-o>]  [-pw <I<password expires in [0..254] days (0 => never)>>]  
      [B<-pi>]  [-h]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<uss bulk> command executes the uss commands listed
in the B<bulk input file> specified with the B<-file>
argument. If the bulk input file includes B<add> instructions
that reference a template file, then the B<-template> argument is
required.

To create a single account, use the uss add command. To
delete one or more accounts, use the B<uss delete> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -file

Specifies the pathname of the bulk input file. Partial pathnames
are interpreted relative to the current working directory. For details
on the file's format, see L<uss Bulk Input File(1)>.

=item -template

Specifies the pathname of the template file for any uss add
commands that appear in the bulk input file. Partial pathnames are
interpreted relative to the current working directory. For details on
the file's format, see L<uss Template File(1)>.

=item -verbose

Produces on the standard output stream a detailed trace of the
command's execution. If this argument is omitted, only warnings
and error messages appear.

=item -cell

Specifies the cell in which to run the command. For more details,
see the introductory B<uss> reference page.

=item -admin

Specifies the AFS user name under which to establish authenticated
connections to the AFS server processes that maintain the various components
of a user account. For more details, see the introductory
B<uss> reference page.

=item -dryrun

Reports actions that the command interpreter needs to perform while
executing the command, without actually performing them. For more
details, see the introductory B<uss> reference page.

=item -skipauth

Prevents authentication with the AFS Authentication Server, allowing a
site using Kerberos to substitute that form of authentication.

=item -overwrite

Overwrites any directories, files and links that exist in the file system
and for which there are also B<D>, B<E>, B<F>,
B<L>, or B<S> instructions in a template file referenced by an
B<add> instruction in the bulk input file. If this flag is
omitted, the command interpreter prompts, once for each B<add>
instruction in the bulk input file, for confirmation that it should overwrite
such elements. Do not include this flag if the bulk input file does not
contain B<add> instructions.

=item -pwexpires

Sets the number of days after a user's password is changed that it
remains valid, for each user named by an B<add> instruction in the
bulk input file. Provide an integer from the range B<1> through
B<254> to specify the number of days until expiration, or the value
B<0> to indicate that the password never expires (the default).

When the password becomes invalid (expires), the user is unable to
authenticate, but has 30 more days in which to issue the B<kpasswd>
command to change the password (after that, only an administrator can change
it).

=item -pipe

Suppresses the Authentication Server's prompt for the password of the
issuer or the user named by the B<-admin> argument (the Authentication
Server always separately authenticates the creator of an entry in the
Authentication Database). Instead, the command interpreter accepts the
password via the standard input stream, as piped in from another
program. This enables the B<uss bulk> command to run as part of
unattended batch jobs.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example command executes the instructions in the bulk input
file called B<new_students>, which includes B<add>
instructions that refer to the template file
B<student.template>. Both files reside in the current
working directory.

   % uss bulk new_students student.template

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer (or the user named by the -admin argument) must have
the privileges necessary to run the commands that correspond to instructions
in the bulk input file.
