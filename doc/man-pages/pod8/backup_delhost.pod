=head1 NAME

backup delhost - Deletes a Tape Coordinator entry from the Backup Database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<backup delhost -tapehost> <I<tape machine name>> [-portoffset <I<TC port offset>>]
[B<-localauth>]  [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>]  [B<-help>]

B<backup delh -t> <I<tape machine name>>  [-p <I<TC port offset>>]
[B<-l>]  [B<-c> <I<cell name>>]  [B<-h>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The backup delhost command deletes the indicated Tape
Coordinator entry from the Backup Database. It is then impossible to
submit backup operations to that Tape Coordinator, even if it is still
running. To keep configuration information consistent, also remove the
corresponding entry from the B</usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig> file on the
Tape Coordinator machine.

To list the Tape Coordinator machines and port offsets defined in the
Backup Database, issue the B<backup listhosts> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -tapehost

Specifies the hostname of the machine housing the Tape Coordinator to
delete.

=item -portoffset

Specifies the port offset number of the Tape Coordinator to delete.
If omitted, it defaults to B<0>. If provided, it is an integer
between B<0> (zero) and B<58510>, and must match the port
offset number assigned to the same combination of Tape Coordinator and tape
device or file in the B</usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig> file on the Tape
Coordinator machine indicated by the B<-tapehost> argument.

=item -localauth

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<backup> command
interpreter presents it to the Backup Server, Volume Server and VL Server
during mutual authentication. Do not combine this flag with the
B<-cell> argument. For more details, see the introductory
B<backup> reference page.

=item -cell

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see the
introductory B<backup> reference page.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command deletes the Backup Database entry for the Tape
Coordinator with port offset 2 on the Tape Coordinator machine
B<backup3.abc.com>:

   % backup delhost -tapehost backup3.abc.com -portoffset 2

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the /usr/afs/etc/UserList file on
every machine where the Backup Server is running, or must be logged onto a
server machine as the local superuser B<root> if the
B<-localauth> flag is included.
