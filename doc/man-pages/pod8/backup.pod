backup - Introduction to the backup command suite

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The commands in the backup command suite are the administrative
interface to the AFS Backup System. There are several categories of
commands in the suite:

=over 4

=item *

Commands to copy data from AFS volumes to tape or a backup data file, and
to restore it to the file system: B<backup diskrestore>,
B<backup dump>, B<backup volrestore>, and B<backup
volsetrestore>


=item *

Commands to administer the records in the Backup Database:
B<backup adddump>, B<backup addhost>, B<backup
addvolentry>, B<backup addvolset>, B<backup deldump>,
B<backup deletedump>, B<backup delhost>, B<backup
delvolentry>, B<backup delvolset>, B<backup dumpinfo>,
B<backup listdumps>, B<backup listhosts>, B<backup
listvolsets>, B<backup scantape>, B<backup setexp>, and
B<backup volinfo>


=item *

Commands to write and read tape labels: backup labeltape
and B<backup readlabel>


=item *

Commands to list and change the status of backup operations and the
machines performing them: B<(backup) jobs>, B<(backup)
kill>, and B<backup status>


=item *

Commands to enter and leave interactive mode: backup
(interactive) and B<(backup) quit>


=item *

Commands to check for and repair corruption in the Backup Database:
B<backup dbverify>, B<backup restoredb>, and B<backup
savedb>


=item *

Commands to obtain help: B<backup apropos> and backup
help


=back

The backup command interpreter interacts with two other
processes:
L<(1)>
L<(1)>

=over 4

=item *

The Backup Server (buserver) process. It maintains the
Backup Database, which stores most of the administrative information used by
the Backup System. In the standard configuration, the Backup Server
runs on each database server machine in the cell, and uses AFS's
distributed database technology, Ubik, to synchronize its copy of the database
with the copies on the other database server machines.


=item *

The Backup Tape Coordinator (butc) process. A separate
instance of the process controls each tape device or backup data file used to
dump or restore data. The Tape Coordinator runs on a Tape Coordinator
machine, which is an AFS server or client machine that has one or more tape
devices attached, or has sufficient disk space to accommodate one or more
backup data files on its local disk.


Each Tape Coordinator must be registered in the Backup Database and in the
B</usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig> configuration file on the Tape
Coordinator machine's local disk, and information in the two places must
be consistent for proper Backup System performance. The optional
B</usr/afs/backup/CFG_>I<device_name> for each Tape Coordinator
records information used to automate its operation.

=back

In addition to the standard command line interface, the backup
command suite provides an I<interactive> interface, which has several
useful features described on the B<backup (interactive)> reference
page. Three of the commands in the suite are available only in
interactive mode: B<(backup) jobs>, B<(backup) kill>,
and B<(backup) quit>.

=head1 OPTIONS

The following options are available on many commands in the
B<backup> suite. The reference page for each command also lists
them, but they are described here in greater detail.
L<(1)>
L<(1)>
L<(1)>

=over 4

=item -cell <I<cell name>
>

Names the cell in which to run the command. It is acceptable to
abbreviate the cell name to the shortest form that distinguishes it from the
other entries in the B</usr/vice/etc/CellServDB> file on the local
machine. If the B<-cell> argument is omitted, the command
interpreter determines the name of the local cell by reading the following in
order: 

=item *

The value of the AFSCELL environment variable


=item *

The local /usr/vice/etc/ThisCell file


Do not combine the B<-cell> and -localauth
options. A command on which the B<-localauth> flag is included
always runs in the local cell (as defined in the server machine's local
B</usr/afs/etc/ThisCell> file), whereas a command on which the
B<-cell> argument is included runs in the specified foreign
cell. 

The -cell argument is not available on commands issued in
interactive mode. The cell defined when the B<backup> command
interpreter enters interactive mode applies to all commands issued during the
interactive session.
L<(1)>

=item -help

Prints a command's online help message on the standard output
stream. Do not combine this flag with any of the command's other
options; when it is provided, the command interpreter ignores all other
options, and only prints the help message.

=item L<(1)
-localauth
>

Constructs a server ticket using the server encryption key with the
highest key version number in the local B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile>
file. The B<backup> command interpreter presents the ticket,
which never expires, to the Backup Server, Volume Server and Volume Location
(VL) Server during mutual authentication. 

Use this flag only when issuing a command on a server machine; client
machines do not usually have a B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file.
The issuer of a command that includes this flag must be logged on to the
server machine as the local superuser B<root>. The flag is
useful for commands invoked by an unattended application program, such as a
process controlled by the UNIX B<cron> utility or by a cron entry in
the machine's B</usr/afs/local/BosConfig> file. It is also
useful if an administrator is unable to authenticate to AFS but is logged in
as the local superuser B<root>. 

Do not combine the B<-cell> and -localauth
options. A command on which the B<-localauth> flag is included
always runs in the local cell (as defined in the server machine's local
B</usr/afs/etc/ThisCell> file), whereas a command on which the
B<-cell> argument is included runs in the specified foreign
cell. 

The -localauth argument is not available on commands issued in
interactive mode. The local identity and AFS tokens with which the
B<backup> command interpreter enters interactive mode apply to all
commands issued during the interactive session.

=item L<(1)
-portoffset <I<TC port offset>>
>

Specifies the port offset number of the Tape Coordinator that is to
execute the B<backup> command. The port offset number uniquely
identifies a pairing of a Tape Coordinator (B<butc>) process and tape
device or backup data file. 

The backup command interpreter and Tape Coordinator process
communicate via a UDP socket, or port. Before issuing a
B<backup> command that involves reading or writing a tape, the backup
operator must start a B<butc> process that controls the appropriate
tape device and listens for requests sent to its port number. If a
Backup System machine has multiple tape devices attached, they can perform
backup operations simultaneously because each device has its own associated
B<butc> process and port offset number.

The Backup System associates a tape capacity and file mark size with each
port offset (as defined in the B<tapeconfig> file). For a
compressing tape device, the capacity and file mark values differ for
compression and non-compression modes, so the two modes have distinct port
offset numbers.

The Backup Database can store up to 58,511 port offsets, so the legal
values for this argument are the integers B<0> through
B<58510>. If the issuer omits the argument, it defaults to
B<0>. (The limit of 58,511 port offsets results from the fact
that UDP socket numbers are identified by a 16-bit integer, and the lowest
socket number used by the Backup System is 7025. The largest number
that a 16-bit integer can represent is 65,535. Subtracting 7,025 yields
58,510. The addition of port offset 0 (zero) increases the maximum to
58,511.)

Although it is possible to define up to 58,511 port offset numbers for a
cell, it is not possible to run 58,511 tape devices simultaneously, due to the
following limits:

=over 4

=item *

The maximum number of dump or restore operations that can run
simultaneously is 64.


=item *

The maximum number of tape devices that can work together on a restore
operation is 128 (that is the maximum number of values that can be provided
for the B<-portoffset> argument to the B<backup diskrestore>,
B<backup volrestore>, or B<backup volsetrestore>
command).


=back

The Backup System does not reserve UDP sockets. If another
application is already using the Tape Coordinator's socket when it tries
to start, the B<butc> process fails and the following error message
appears at the shell prompt:

   bind: Address already in use
   rxi_GetUDPSocket: bind failed

=back

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

To issue any backup command that accesses the Backup Database
only, the issuer must be listed in the B</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file
on every machine where the Backup Server is running. To issue any
B<backup> command that accesses volume data, the issuer must appear in
the B<UserList> file on every Backup Server machine, every Volume
Location (VL) Server machine, and every file server machine that houses
affected volumes. By convention, a common B<UserList> file is
distributed to all database server and file server machines in the
cell. See the chapter on privileged users in the I<IBM AFS
Administration Guide> for more information on this type of
privilege.

If the -localauth flag is included, the user must instead be
logged on as the local superuser B<root> on the server machine where
the B<backup> command is issued.
