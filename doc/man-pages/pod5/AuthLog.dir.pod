=head1 NAME

AuthLog.dir, AuthLog.pag - Records privileged operations performed by the Authentication Server

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<AuthLog.dir> and AuthLog.pag files
record a trace of privileged operations performed by the Authentication Server
(B<kaserver> process) on the local machine. If the files do not
exist when the Authentication Server starts, it creates them in the
B</usr/afs/logs> directory as necessary.

The files are in binary format. To display their contents, use the
B<kdb> command, which requires being logged in to the local machine as
the local superuser B<root>.

=head1 CAUTIONS

The Authentication Server is possibly unable to create these files on some
operating systems that AFS otherwise supports, making the B<kdb>
command inoperative. See the I<IBM AFS Release Notes> for
details.
