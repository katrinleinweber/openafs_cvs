=head1 NAME

SalvageLog - Traces Salvager operations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The SalvageLog file records a trace of Salvager
(B<salvager> process) operations on the local machine and describes
any error conditions it encounters.

If the SalvageLog file does not already exist in the
B</usr/afs/logs> directory when the Salvager starts, the process
creates it and writes initial start-up messages to it. If there is an
existing file, the Salvager renames is to B<SalvageLog.old>,
overwriting the existing B<SalvageLog.old> file if it
exists.

The file is in ASCII format. Administrators listed in the
B</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file can use the B<bos getlog>
command to display its contents. Alternatively, log onto the file
server machine and use a text editor or a file display command such as the
UNIX B<cat> command. By default, the mode bits on the
B<SalvageLog> file grant the required B<r> (B<read>)
permission to all users.

The Salvager records operations only as it completes them, and cannot
recover from failures by reviewing the file. The log contents are
useful for administrative evaluation of process failures and other
problems.
