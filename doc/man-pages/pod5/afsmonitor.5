=head1 NAME

afsmonitor Configuration File - Provides instructions for the afsmonitor command

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The afsmonitor configuration file determines which machines the
B<afsmonitor> command probes for File Server or Cache Manager
statistics and which statistics it gathers. Use the B<-config>
argument to the B<afsmonitor> command to identify the configuration
file to use.

The instructions that can appear in the configuration file are as
follows:

=over 4

=item C<cm  I<host_name>
>

Names a client machine for which to display Cache Manager
statistics. The order of B<cm> lines in the file determines the
order in which client machines appear from top to bottom on the C<System
Overview> and C<Cache Managers> output screens.

=item C<fs  I<host_name>
>

Names a file server machine for which to display File Server
statistics. The order of B<fs> lines in the file determines the
order in which file server machines appear from top to bottom on the
C<System Overview> and C<File Servers> output screens.

=item C<thresh  fs | cm  I<field_name  I<thresh_val> 
[I<cmd_to_run>]  [I<arg>

Assigns the threshold value I<thresh_val> to the statistic
I<field_name>, for either a File Server statistic (B<fs>) or a
Cache Manager statistic (B<cm>). The optional
I<cmd_to_execute> field names a binary or script to execute each time
the value of the statistic changes from being below I<thresh_val> to
being at or above I<thresh_val>. A change between two values that
both exceed I<thresh_val> does not retrigger the binary or
script. The optional I<arg>
The B<afsmonitor> program passes the following parameters to the
I<cmd_to_execute>&#58;

=item I<host_name fs|cm I<field_name>
I<threshold_val>
I<actual_val> [<I<arg>

The parameters B<fs>, cm, I<field_name>,
I<threshold_val>, and I<arg>

Use the thresh line to set either a global threshold, which
applies to all file server machines listed on B<fs> lines or client
machines listed on B<cm> lines in the configuration file, or a
machine-specific threshold, which applies to only one file server or client
machine.

=over 4

=item *

To set a global threshold, place the thresh line before any of
the B<fs> or B<cm> lines in the file.


=item *

To set a machine-specific threshold, place the thresh line
below the corresponding B<fs> or B<cm> line, and above any
other B<fs> or B<cm> lines. A machine-specific
threshold value always overrides the corresponding global threshold, if
set. Do not place a B<thresh fs> line directly after a
B<cm> line or a B<thresh cm> line directly after a
B<fs> line.


=back

=item C<show  fs | cm  I<field/group/section>
>

Specifies which individual statistic, group of statistics, or section of
statistics to display on the C<File Servers> screen (B<fs>) or
C<Cache Managers> screen (B<cm>) and the order in which to
display them. The appendix of B<afsmonitor> statistics in the
I<IBM AFS Administration Guide> specifies the group and section to
which each statistic belongs. Include as many B<show> lines as
necessary to customize the screen display as desired, and place them anywhere
in the file. The top-to-bottom order of the B<show> lines in
the configuration file determines the left-to-right order in which the
statistics appear on the corresponding screen.

If there are no show lines in the configuration file, then the
screens display all statistics for both Cache Managers and File
Servers. Similarly, if there are no B<show fs> lines, the
C<File Servers> screen displays all file server statistics, and if
there are no B<show cm> lines, the C<Cache Managers> screen
displays all client statistics.

=item # I<comments
>

Precedes a line of text that the afsmonitor program ignores
because of the initial number (B<#>) sign, which must appear in the
very first column of the line.

I<field/group/section> field of a B<show> instruction, see the
B<afsmonitor> statistics appendix to the I<IBM AFS Administration
Guide>.
