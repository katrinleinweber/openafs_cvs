=head1 NAME

krb.conf - Configures the kerberos realm to AFS cell mapping

=head1 DESCRIPTION

/usr/vice/etc/krb.conf is an optional file that resides on an OpenAFS
server and is used to specify which Kerberos5 realms are trusted to
authenticate to the local AFS cell. The format of the file is one realm
per line. If the Kerberos5 realm matches the AFS cell name
(case-insensitive), then this file can be omitted. krb.conf is only needed
when the Kerberos5 realm does not match the cell name or multiple
Kerberos5 realms authenticate to the same AFS cell.
