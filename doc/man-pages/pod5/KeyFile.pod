=head1 NAME

KeyFile - Defines AFS server encryption keys

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The KeyFile file defines the server encryption keys that the AFS
server processes running on the machine use to decrypt the tickets presented
by clients during the mutual authentication process. AFS server
processes perform privileged actions only for clients that possess a ticket
encrypted with one of the keys from the file. The file must reside in
the B</usr/afs/etc> directory on every server machine. For more
detailed information on mutual authentication and server encryption keys, see
the I<IBM AFS Administration Guide>.

Each key has a corresponding a key version number that distinguishes it
from the other keys. The tickets that clients present are also marked
with a key version number to tell the server process which key to use to
decrypt it. The B<KeyFile> file must always include a key with
the same key version number and contents as the key currently listed for the
B<afs> entry in the Authentication Database.

The KeyFile file is in binary format, so always use the
appropriate commands from the B<bos> command suite to administer
it:

=over 4

=item *

The bos addkey command to define a new key


=item *

The bos listkeys command to display the keys


=item *

The bos removekey command to remove a key from the file


=back

In cells that run the United States edition of AFS and use the Update
Server to distribute the contents of the B</usr/afs/etc> directory, it
is customary to edit only the copy of the file stored on the system control
machine. In cells that run the international version of AFS, edit the
file on each server machine individually.
