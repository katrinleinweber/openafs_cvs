=head1 NAME

vos backup - Creates a backup volume for a single read/write volume

=head1 SYNOPSIS


B<vos backup -id> <I<volume name or ID>>  [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>]  [-noauth]  
[B<-localauth>]  [B<-verbose>]  [B<-help>]
   
B<vos backup -i> <I<volume name or ID>>  [B<-c> <I<cell name>>]  [B<-n>]  [B<-l>]  [B<-v>]  [-h]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The vos backup command clones the indicated read/write volume to
create a backup version, placing it at the same site as the read/write
version. The backup volume's name is the same as the read/write
source's with the addition of the B<.backup>
extension. Its volume ID number is the one allocated for it in the
Volume Location Database (VLDB) when the read/write source was created with
the B<vos create> command. If a backup version already exists,
the new clone replaces it.

To create a backup version of multiple volumes, use the vos
backupsys command.
