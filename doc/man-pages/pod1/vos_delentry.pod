       [B<-s> <I<machine name>>]  [B<-pa> <I<partition name>>]  [-c <I<cell name>>] 
       [B<-n>]  [B<-l>]  [B<-v>]  [-h]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The vos delentry command removes the Volume Location Database
(VLDB) entry for each specified volume. A specified volume can be any
of the three types (read/write, read-only, or backup), but the entire entry is
removed no matter which type is provided. The command has no effect on
the actual volumes on file server machines, if they exist.

This command is useful if a volume removal operation did not update the
VLDB (perhaps because the B<vos zap> command was used), but the system
administrator does not feel it is necessary to use the B<vos syncserv>
and B<vos syncvldb> commands to synchronize an entire file server
machine.

To remove the VLDB entry for a single volume, use the  -id
argument. To remove groups of volumes, combine the B< -prefix>,
B<-server>, and B<-partition> arguments. The following
list describes how to remove the VLDB entry for the indicated group of
volumes:

=over 4

=item *

For every volume whose name begins with a certain character string (for
example, B<sys.> or B<user.>): use the
B<-prefix> argument.


=item *

Every volume for which the VLDB lists a site on a certain file server
machine: specify the file server name with the B<-server>
argument.


=item *

Every volume for which the VLDB lists a site on a partition of the same
name (for instance, on the B</vicepa> partition on any file server
machine): specify the partition name with the B< -partition>
argument.


=item *

Every volume for which the VLDB lists a site one a specific partition of a
file server machine: specify both the B<-server> and
B<-partition> arguments.


=item *

Every volume whose name begins with a certain prefix and for which the
VLDB lists a site on a file server machine: combine the
B<-prefix> and B<-server> arguments. Combine the
B<-prefix> argument with the B<-partition> argument, or both
the B<-server> and B<-partition> arguments, to remove a more
specific group of volumes.


=back

=head1 CAVEATS

Do not use this command to remove a volume in normal circumstances; it
does not remove a volume from the file server machine, and so is likely to
make the VLDB inconsistent with state of the volumes on server
machines. Use the B<vos remove> command to remove both the
volume and its VLDB entry.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -id

Specifies the complete name or the volume ID number of each volume for
which to remove the VLDB entry. The entire entry is removed, regardless
of whether the read/write, read-only, or backup version is indicated.
Provide this argument or some combination of the B<-prefix>,
B<-server>, and B<-partition> arguments.

=item -prefix

Specifies a character string of any length; the VLDB entry for a
volume whose name begins with the string is removed. Include field
separators (such as periods) if appropriate. Combine this argument with
the B<-server> argument, B<-partition> argument, or
both.

=item -server

Identifies a file server machine; if a volume's VLDB entry lists
a site on the machine, the entry is removed. Provide the machine's
IP address or its host name (either fully qualified or using an unambiguous
abbreviation). For details, see the introductory reference page for the
B<vos> command suite. 

Combine this argument with the -prefix argument, the
B<-partition> argument, or both.

=item -partition

Identifies a partition; if a volume's VLDB entry lists a site on
the partition, the entry is removed. Provide the partition's
complete name with preceding slash (for example, B</vicepa>) or use
one of the three acceptable abbreviated forms. For details, see the
introductory reference page for the B<vos> command suite. 

Combine this argument with the -prefix argument, the
B<-server> argument, or both.

=item -cell

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see the
introductory B<vos> reference page.

=item -noauth

Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the
issuer. Do not combine this flag with the B<-localauth>
flag. For more details, see the introductory B<vos> reference
page.

=item -localauth

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<vos> command
interpreter presents it to the Volume Server and Volume Location Server during
mutual authentication. Do not combine this flag with the
B<-cell> argument or B<-noauth> flag. For more details,
see the introductory B<vos> reference page.

=item -verbose

Produces on the standard output stream a detailed trace of the
command's execution. If this argument is omitted, only warnings
and error messages appear.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

The following message confirms the success of the command by indicating how
many VLDB entries were removed.

   Deleted I<number> VLDB entries

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command removes the VLDB entry for the volume
B<user.temp>.

   % vos delentry user.temp

The following command removes the VLDB entry for every volume whose name
begins with the string B<test> and for which the VLDB lists a site on
the file server machine B<fs3.abc.com>.

   % vos delentry -prefix test -server fs3.abc.com

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the /usr/afs/etc/UserList file on
the machine specified with the B<-server> argument and on each
database server machine. If the B<-localauth> flag is included,
the issuer must instead be logged on to a server machine as the local
superuser B<root>.
