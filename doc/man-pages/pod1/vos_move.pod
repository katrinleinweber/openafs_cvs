vos move - Moves a read/write volume to another site

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<vos move -id> <I<volume name or ID>>  -fromserver <I<machine name on source>>

B<vos m -i> <I<volume name or ID>>  -froms <I<machine name on source>> 
B<-fromp> <I<partition name on source>>  B<-tos> <I<machine name on destination>>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The vos move command moves the indicated read/write volume from
its current site (specified with the B<-fromserver> and
B<-frompartition> arguments) to the destination site (specified with
the B<-toserver> and B<-topartition> arguments). This
command automatically removes the backup copy from the current site, if it
exists. To create a new backup volume at the destination site, use the
B<vos backup> command.

This command works on read/write volumes only. To move a read-only
volume, use the B<vos addsite> and B<vos release> commands to
define a new read-only site and release the volume contents to it, and then
use the B<vos remove> command to remove the previous read-only
volume's definition from the Volume Location Database (VLDB) and data
from the partition. To move a backup volume, use this command to move
its read/write source and then issue the B<vos backup> command.

Before executing this command, the vos command interpreter
initiates a check that the destination partition contains enough space to
house the volume being moved. If there is not enough space, the move
operation is not attempted and the following message appears:

   vos: no space on target partition I<dest_part> to move volume I<volume>

=head1 CAVEATS

Unless there is a compelling reason, do not interrupt a vos move
command in progress. Interrupting a move can result in one or more of
the following inconsistent states:

=over 4

=item *

There are two versions of the volume, one at the source site and one at
the destination site. (If this happens, retain the version identified
by the VLDB and use the B<vos zap> command to remove the other
version.)


=item *

The backup version of the volume is stranded at the old site. (If
this happens, use the B<vos zap> command to remove it.)


=item *

The volume is off-line. (If this happens, run the bos
salvage command to bring it back on line.)


=back

If the <B<Ctrl-c>> interrupt signal is pressed while a vos
move operation is executing, the following message warns of the
consequences and requests confirmation of the kill signal:

   SIGINT handler: vos move operation in progress
   WARNING: may leave AFS storage and metadata in indeterminate state
   enter second control-c to exit

To confirm termination of the operation, press <Ctrl-c> a
second time; press any other key to continue the operation.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -id

Specifies either the complete name or volume ID number of a read/write
volume.

=item -fromserver

Identifies the file server machine where the volume currently
resides. Provide the machine's IP address or its host name (either
fully qualified or using an unambiguous abbreviation). For details, see
the introductory reference page for the B<vos> command suite.

=item -frompartition

Names the partition where the volume currently resides. Provide the
full partition name (for, example, B</vicepa>) or one of the
abbreviated forms described on the introductory B<vos> reference
page.

=item -toserver

Identifies the file server machine to which to move the volume.
Provide the machine's IP address or its host name (either fully qualified
or using an unambiguous abbreviation). For details, see the
introductory reference page for the B<vos> command suite.

=item -topartition

Names the partition to which to move the volume. Provide the full
partition name (for, example, B</vicepa>) or one of the abbreviated
forms described on the introductory B<vos> reference page.

=item -cell

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see the
introductory B<vos> reference page.

=item -noauth

Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the
issuer. Do not combine this flag with the B<-localauth>
flag. For more details, see the introductory B<vos> reference
page.

=item -localauth

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<vos> command
interpreter presents it to the Volume Server and Volume Location Server during
mutual authentication. Do not combine this flag with the
B<-cell> argument or B<-noauth> flag. For more details,
see the introductory B<vos> reference page.

=item -verbose

Produces on the standard output stream a detailed trace of the
command's execution. If this argument is omitted, only warnings
and error messages appear.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example moves the volume user.smith from
the B</vicepb> partition on the file server machine
B<fs3.abc.com> to the B</vicepg> partition on
the file server machine B<fs7.abc.com>.

   % vos move -id user.smith -fromserver fs3.abc.com -frompartition b  \
              -toserver fs7.abc.com -topartition g

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the /usr/afs/etc/UserList file on
the machines specified with the B<-toserver> and
B<-fromserver> arguments and on each database server machine.
If the B<-localauth> flag is included, the issuer must instead be
logged on to a server machine as the local superuser B<root>.
