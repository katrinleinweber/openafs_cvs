=head1 NAME

sys - Reports the CPU/operating system type

=head1 SYNOPSIS

sys

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<sys> command displays the string stored in kernel memory that
indicates the local machine's CPU/operating system (OS) type. The Cache
Manager substitutes the string for the I<@sys> variable which can occur in
AFS pathnames; the I<IBM AFS Quick Beginnings> and I<IBM AFS
Administration Guide> explain how using I<@sys> can simplify cell
configuration.

The command always reports the value for the local machine only. To set a
new value in kernel memory, use the B<fs sysname> command, which like this
command can also be used to display the current value.

=head1 OUTPUT

The machine's system type appears as a text string:

   I<system_type>

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example shows the output produced on a Sun SPARCStation
running Solaris 5.7:

   % sys
   sun4x_57
