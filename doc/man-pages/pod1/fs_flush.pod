=head1 NAME

fs flush - Forces the Cache Manager to discard a cached file or directory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<fs flush> [B<-path> <I<dir/file path>>+]  [-help]

B<fs flush> [B<-p> <I<dir/file path>>+]  [-h]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The fs flush command removes from the cache all data and status
information associated with each specified file or directory. The next
time an application requests data from the flushed directory or file, the
Cache Manager fetches the most current version from a File Server, along with
a new callback (if necessary) and associated status information. This
command has no effect on two types of data:

=item *

Data in application program buffers


=item *

Data that has been changed locally and written to the cache but not yet
written to the copy on the file server machine


To flush all data in the cache that was fetched from the same volume as a
specified file or directory, use the B<fs flushvolume> command.
To flush a corrupted mount point, use the B<fs flushmount>
command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -path

Names each file or directory to flush from the cache. If it is a
directory, only the directory element itself is flushed, not data cached from
files or subdirectories that reside in it. Partial pathnames are
interpreted relative to the current working directory, which is also the
default value if this argument is omitted.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command flushes from the cache the file
B<projectnotes> in the current working directory and all data from the
subdirectory B<plans>:

   % fs flush -path projectnotes ./plans/*

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must have the B<l> (lookup) permission on the
ACL of the root directory of the volume that houses the file or directory
named by the B<-path> argument, and on the ACL of each directory that
precedes it in the pathname.
