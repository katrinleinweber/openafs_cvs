=head1 OUTPUT

The output includes a line for each specified directory or file. It
names the file server machine on which the volume that houses the specified
directory or file resides. A list of multiple machines indicates that
the directory or file is in a replicated volume.

Machine names usually have a suffix indicating their cell
membership. If the cell is not clear, use the B<fs whichcell>
command to display the cell in which the directory or file resides. To
display the cell membership of the local machine, use the B<fs wscell>
command.

The following example indicates that volume housing the directory
B</afs/abc.com> resides is replicated on both
B<fs1.abc.com> and
B<fs3.abc.com>:

   % fs whereis -path /afs/abc.com
   File /afs/abc.com is on hosts fs1.abc.com fs3.abc.com
