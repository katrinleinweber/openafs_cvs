=head1 NAME

fs lsmount - Reports the volume for which a directory is the mount point.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<fs lsmount -dir> <I<directory>>+  [-help]

B<fs ls -d> <I<directory>>+  [-h] 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The fs lsmount command reports the volume for which each
specified directory is a mount point, or indicates with an error message that
a directory is not a mount point or is not in AFS.

To create a mount point, use the fs mkmount command. To
remove one, use the B<fs rmmount> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -dir

Names the directory that serves as a mount point for a volume. The
last element in the pathname provided must be an actual name, not a shorthand
notation such as one or two periods (B<.> or
B<..>).

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

If the specified directory is a mount point, the output is of the following
form:

   'I<directory>' is a mount point for volume 'I<volume name>'

where 

=over 4

=item *

A number sign (C<#>) precedes the I<volume name> string for
a regular mount point.


=item *

A percent sign (C<%>) precedes the I<volume name> string for
a read/write mount point.


=item *

A cell name and colon (C<:>) follow the number or percent
sign and precede the I<volume name> string for a cellular mount
point.


=back

The fs mkmount reference page explains how the Cache Manager
interprets each of the three types of mount points.

If the directory is a symbolic link to a mount point, the output is of the
form:

   'I<directory>' is a symbolic link, leading to a mount point for volume 'I<volume name>'

If the directory is not a mount point or is not in AFS, the output
reads:

   'I<directory>' is not a mount point.

If the output is garbled, it is possible that the mount point has become
corrupted in the local AFS client cache. Use the B<fs
flushmount> command to discard it, which forces the Cache Manager to
refetch the mount point.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example shows the mount point for the home directory of user
B<smith>:

   % fs lsmount /afs/abc.com/usr/smith
   '/afs/abc.com/usr/smith' is a mount point for volume '#user.smith'

The following example shows both the regular and read/write mount points
for the ABC Corporation cell's C<root.cell> volume.

   % fs lsmount /afs/abc.com
   '/afs/abc.com' is a mount point for volume '#root.cell'

   % fs lsmount /afs/.abc.com
   '/afs/.abc.com' is a mount point for volume '%root.cell'
   

The following example shows a cellular mount point: the State
University cell's C<root.cell> volume as mounted in the
ABC Corporation cell's tree.

   % fs lsmount /afs/stateu.edu
   '/afs/stateu.edu' is a mount point for volume '#stateu.edu:root.cell'

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must have the B<l> (lookup) permission on the
ACL of the root directory of the volume that houses the file or directory
named by the B<-dir> argument, and on the ACL of each directory that
precedes it in the pathname.
