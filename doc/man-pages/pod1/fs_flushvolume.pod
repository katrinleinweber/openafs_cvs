=head1 NAME

fs flushvolume - Forces the Cache Manager to discard all cached data from the volume
containing a file or directory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<fs flushvolume> [B<-path> <I<dir/file path>>+]  [-help]

B<fs flushv> [B<-p> <I<dir/file path>>+]  [-h]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The fs flushvolume command removes from the cache all data that
was fetched from the same volume as each specified directory or file.
It does not discard cached status information. The next time an
application requests data from a flushed directory or file, the Cache Manager
fetches the most current version from a File Server, along with a new callback
(if necessary) and associated status information. This command has no
effect on two types of data:

=item *

Data in application program buffers


=item *

Data that has been changed locally and written to the cache but not yet
written to the copy on the file server machine


To discard the data and status information associated with individual files
and directories, use the B<fs flush> command. To flush a
corrupted mount point, use the B<fs flushmount> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -path

Names a file or directory from each volume for which to discard all cached
data. Partial pathnames are interpreted relative to the current working
directory, which is also the default value if this argument is omitted.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command flushes from the cache all data fetched from the
volume that contains the current working directory:

   % fs flushvolume 

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must have the B<l> (lookup) permission on the
ACL of the root directory of the volume that houses the file or directory
named by the B<-path> argument, and on the ACL of each directory that
precedes it in the pathname.
