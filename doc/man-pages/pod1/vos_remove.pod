=head1 NAME

vos remove - Removes a volume from a site

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<vos remove> [B<-server> <I<machine name>>]  [-partition <I<partition name>>]
B<-id> <I<volume name or ID>>  [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>]
           [B<-noauth>]  [B<-localauth>]  [B<-verbose>]  [-help]

B<vos remo> [B<-s> <I<machine name>>]  [B<-p> <I<partition name>>]  -i <I<volume name or ID>> 
[B<-c> <I<cell name>>]  [B<-n>]  [B<-l>]  [B<-v>]  [B<-h>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The vos remove command removes the indicated volume from the
partition on which it resides. The Volume Location Database (VLDB)
record is altered appropriately, as described in the following
paragraphs. Use this command to remove any of the three types of
volumes; the effect depends on the type.

=over 4

=item *

If the -id argument names the read/write volume (that is,
specifies the volume's base name), both it and the associated backup
volume are removed from the partition that houses them. The
B<-server> and B<-partition> arguments are optional, because
there can be only one read/write site. When the volume is removed, the
site information is also removed from the VLDB entry. The read/write
and backup volume ID numbers no longer appear in the output from the B<vos
listvldb> or B<vos examine> commands, but they are preserved
internally. Read-only sites, if any, are not affected, but cannot be
changed unless a read/write site is again defined. The site count
reported by the B<vos examine> and B<vos listvldb> commands as
C<number of sites> decrements by one. The entire VLDB entry is
removed if there are no read-only sites.


=item *

If the -id argument names a read-only volume, it is removed
from the partition that houses it, and the corresponding site information is
removed from the VLDB entry. The site count reported by the B<vos
examine> and B<vos listvldb> commands as C<number of
sites> decrements by one for each volume you remove. If there is
more than one read-only site, the B<-server> argument (and optionally
B<-partition> argument) must be used to specify the site from which to
remove the volume. If there is only one read-only site, the
B<-id> argument is sufficient; if there is also no read/write
volume in this case, the entire VLDB entry is removed.


=item *

If the -id argument names a backup volume, it is removed from
the partition that houses it. The B<-server> and
B<-partition> arguments are optional, because there can be only one
backup site. The backup volume ID number no longer appears in the
output from the B<vos listvldb> command or in the corresponding
portion of the output from the B<vos examine> command, but is
preserved internally.


=back

This command is the most appropriate one for removing volumes in almost all
cases. Other commands that remove only volumes or only VLDB entries
(such as the B<vos delentry>, B<vos remsite> and B<vos
zap> commands) by definition can put the volumes and VLDB out of
sync. Use them only in the special circumstances mentioned on their
reference pages. Like the B<vos delentry> command, this command
can remove a VLDB entry when no corresponding volumes exist on the file server
machine. Like the B<vos zap> command, this command can remove a
volume that does not have a VLDB entry, as long as the volume is online,
B<-server> and B<-partition> arguments are provided, and the
B<-id> argument specifies the volume's ID number.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -server

Identifies the file server machine that houses the volume to
remove. It is necessary only when the B<-id> argument names a
read-only volume that exists at multiple sites. Provide the
machine's IP address or its host name (either fully qualified or using an
unambiguous abbreviation). For details, see the introductory reference
page for the B<vos> command suite.

=item -partition

Identifies the partition (on the file server machine specified by the
B<-server> argument) that houses the volume to remove. Provide
the partition's complete name with preceding slash (for example,
B</vicepa>) or use one of the three acceptable abbreviated
forms. For details, see the introductory reference page for the
B<vos> command suite. 

Including this argument is necessary only when the -id argument
names a read-only volume that exists at multiple sites. Provide the
B<-server> argument along with this one.

=item -id

Identifies the volume to remove, either by its complete name or volume ID
number. If identifying a read-only or backup volume by name, include
the appropriate extension (B<.readonly> or
B<.backup>).

=item -cell

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see the
introductory B<vos> reference page.

=item -noauth

Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the
issuer. Do not combine this flag with the B<-localauth>
flag. For more details, see the introductory B<vos> reference
page.

=item -localauth

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<vos> command
interpreter presents it to the Volume Server and Volume Location Server during
mutual authentication. Do not combine this flag with the
B<-cell> argument or B<-noauth> flag. For more details,
see the introductory B<vos> reference page.

=item -verbose

Produces on the standard output stream a detailed trace of the
command's execution. If this argument is omitted, only warnings
and error messages appear.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example removes the read/write volume
B<user.terry> and its backup version, if any.

   % vos remove  -id user.terry

The following example removes the read-only volume
B<root.afs.readonly> from one of its sites, the
B</vicepa> partition on the file server machine
B<fs1.abc.com>.

   % vos remove fs1.abc.com  a  root.afs.readonly

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the /usr/afs/etc/UserList file on
the machine specified with the B<-server> argument and on each
database server machine. If the B<-localauth> flag is included,
the issuer must instead be logged on to a server machine as the local
superuser B<root>.
