=head1 NAME

vos addsite - Adds a read-only site definition to a volume's VLDB entry

=head1 SYNOPSIS

vos addsite -server <I<machine name for new site>>
B<-partition> <I<partition name for new site>>
            B<-id> <I<volume name or ID>>  [-cell <I<cell name>>]  
            [B<-noauth>]  [B<-localauth>]  [B<-verbose>]  [-help]

B<vos ad -s> <I<machine name for new site>>  -p <I<partition name for new site>>
B<-i> <I<volume name or ID>>  [B<-c> <I<cell name>>]  [B<-n>]  [B<-l>]  [B<-v>]  [B<-h>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The vos addsite command defines a new read-only site (partition
on a file server machine, specified by the B<-server> and
B<-partition> arguments) in the Volume Location Database (VLDB) entry
of the read/write volume named by the B<-id> argument. When the
B<vos release> command is next issued against the read/write volume, a
read-only copy of it is distributed to all of the read-only sites, including
the newly defined one.

=head1 CAVEATS

A volume's VLDB entry accommodates a maximum number of site
definitions, as defined in the I<IBM AFS Release Notes>. The
site housing the read/write and backup versions of the volume counts as one
site, and each read-only site counts as an additional site (even the read-only
site defined on the same file server machine and partition as the read/write
site counts as a separate site). The limit in the VLDB entry
effectively determines the maximum number of copies of the volume that are
available to AFS clients.

Attempts to create additional sites by using this command fail with an
error.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -server

Identifies the file server machine where the read-only volume is to
reside. Provide the machine's IP address or its host name (either
fully qualified or using an unambiguous abbreviation). For details, see
the introductory reference page for the B<vos> command suite.

=item -partition

Identifies the partition where the read-only volume is to reside, on the
file server machine named by the B<-server> argument. Provide
the partition's complete name with preceding slash (for example,
B</vicepa>) or use one of the three acceptable abbreviated
forms. For details, see the introductory reference page for the
B<vos> command suite.

=item -id

Specifies either the complete name or volume ID number of the read/write
source volume.

=item -cell

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see the
introductory B<vos> reference page.

=item -noauth

Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the
issuer. Do not combine this flag with the B<-localauth>
flag. For more details, see the introductory B<vos> reference
page.

=item -localauth

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<vos> command
interpreter presents it to the Volume Server and Volume Location Server during
mutual authentication. Do not combine this flag with the
B<-cell> argument or B<-noauth> flag. For more details,
see the introductory B<vos> reference page.

=item -verbose

Produces on the standard output stream a detailed trace of the
command's execution. If this argument is omitted, only warnings
and error messages appear.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example, appropriate in the State University cell, defines a
read-only site for the cell's B<root.afs> volume.

   % vos addsite -server sv7.stateu.edu -partition /vicepb -id root.afs

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the /usr/afs/etc/UserList file on
the machine specified with the B<-server> argument and on each
database server machine. If the B<-localauth> flag is included,
the issuer must instead be logged on to a server machine as the local
superuser B<root>.
