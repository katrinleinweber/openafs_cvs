=head1 NAME

pts adduser - Adds a user or machine to a Protection Database group

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pts adduser -user> <I<user name>>+  -group <I<group name>>+ 
[B<-cell> <I<cell name>>]  [B<-noauth>]  [B<-force>]  [B<-help>]

B<pts ad -u> <I<user name>>+  B<-g> <I<group name>>+  [B<-c> <I<cell name>>]  [B<-n>]  [B<-f>]  [-h]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The pts adduser command adds each user or machine entry named by
the B<-user> argument as a member of each group named by the
B<-group> argument.

To remove members of a group, use the pts removeuser
command. To list the groups to which a user or machine belongs, or the
members of a specified group, use the B<pts membership>
command.

=head1 CAVEATS

After being added as a group member, a currently authenticated user must
reauthenticate (for example, by issuing the B<klog> command) to obtain
permissions granted to the group on an access control list (ACL).

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -user

Specifies the name of each user or machine entry to add to each group
named by the B<-group> argument. The name of a machine entry
resembles an IP address and can use the wildcard notation described on the
B<pts createuser> reference page. The user or machine entry
must already exist in the Protection Database.

=item -group

Specifies the complete name (including the owner prefix if applicable) of
each group to which to add members. The group entry must already exist
in the Protection Database.

=item -cell

Names the cell in which to run the command. For more details, see
the introductory B<pts> reference page.

=item -noauth

Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the
issuer. For more details, see the introductory B<pts> reference
page.

=item -force

Enables the command to continue executing as far as possible when errors
or other problems occur, rather than halting execution at the first
error.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example adds user smith to the group
B<system:administrators>.

   % pts adduser -user smith -group system:administrators

The following example adds users B<jones>, terry, and
B<pat> to the B<smith:colleagues> group.

   % pts adduser -user jones terry pat -group smith:colleagues

The following example adds the machine entries in the ABC Corporation
subnet to the group B<bin-prot>. Because of the IP address
range of the ABC Corporation subnet, the system administrator was able to
group the machines into three machine entries (using the wildcard notation
discussed on the B<pts createuser> reference page).

   % pts adduser -user 138.255.0.0 192.12.105.0 192.12.106.0 -group bin-prot

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The required privilege depends on the setting of the fourth privacy flag in
the Protection Database entry for each group named by the B<-group>
argument (use the B<pts examine> command to display the flags):

=over 4

=item *

If it is the hyphen, only the group's owner and members of the
B<system:administrators> group can add members.


=item *

If it is lowercase C<a>, current members of the group can add new
members.


=item *

If it is uppercase C<A>, anyone who can access the cell's
database server machines can add new members.
