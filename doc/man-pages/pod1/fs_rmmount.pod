=head1 NAME

fs rmmount - Removes a mount point

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<fs rmmount -dir> <I<directory>>+  [-help]

B<fs rm -d> <I<directory>>+  [-h]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The fs rmmount command removes the mount point named by the
B<-dir> argument from the file system. The corresponding volume
remains on its host partition or partitions, but is inaccessible if there are
no other mount points for it.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -dir

Names the mount point to delete from the file system. The last
element in the pathname must be an actual name, not a shorthand notation such
as "dot" (.) or "dot dot" (. .). 

Specify the read/write path to the directory, to avoid the failure that
results from attempting to delete a mount point from a read-only
volume. By convention, the read/write path is indicated by placing a
period before the cell name at the pathname's second level (for example,
B</afs/.abc.com>). For further discussion of the
concept of read/write and read-only paths through the filespace, see the
B<fs mkmount> reference page.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command removes the mount points jones and
B<terry> from the current working directory (the
B</afs/abc.com/usr> directory).

   % fs rmmount jones terry

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must have the B<d> (delete) permission on the
ACL of the directory that houses each mount point.
