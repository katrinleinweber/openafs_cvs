=head1 NAME

pts membership - Displays the membership list for a user or group

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pts membership -nameorid> <I<user or group name or id>>+  [-cell <I<cell name>>]  
[B<-noauth>]  [B<-force>]  [B<-help>]

B<pts m -na> <I<user or group name or id>>+  [B<-c> <I<cell name>>]  [B<-no>]  [B<-f>]  [-h]

B<pts groups -na> <I<user or group name or id>>+  [-c <I<cell name>>]
[B<-no>] [B<-f>]  [B<-h>]
   
B<pts g -na> <I<user or group name or id>>+  [B<-c> <I<cell name>>]  [B<-no>]  [B<-f>]  [-h]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The pts membership command lists the groups to which each user
or machine specified by the B<-nameorid> argument belongs, or lists
the users and machines that belong to each group specified by the
B<-nameorid> argument.

It is not possible to list the members of the
B<system:anyuser> or B<system:authuser> groups,
and they do not appear in the list of groups to which a user belongs.

To add users or machine to groups, use the pts adduser
command; to remove them, use the B<pts removeuser>
command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -nameorid

Specifies the name or AFS UID of each user entry, the IP address (complete
or wildcard-style) or AFS UID of each machine entry, or the name or AFS GID of
each group, for which to list group membership. It is acceptable to mix
users, machines, and groups on the same command line, as well as names and
IDs. Precede the GID of each group with a hyphen to indicate that it is
negative.

=item -cell

Names the cell in which to run the command. For more details, see
the introductory B<pts> reference page.

=item -noauth

Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the
issuer. For more details, see the introductory B<pts> reference
page.

=item -force

Enables the command to continue executing as far as possible when errors
or other problems occur, rather than halting execution at the first
error.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=head1 OUTPUT

For each user and machine, the output begins with the following header
line, followed by a list of the groups to which the user or machine
belongs:

   Groups I<name> (id: I<AFS UID>) is a member of:

For each group, the output begins with the following header line, followed
by a list of the users and machines who belong to the group:

   Members of I<group_name> (id: I<AFS GID>) are:

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example lists the groups to which the user pat
belongs and the members of the group B<smith:friends>.
Note that third privacy flag for the B<pat> entry was changed from the
default hyphen to enable a non-administrative user to obtain this
listing.

   % pts membership pat smith:friends
   Groups pat (id: 1144) is a member of:
     smith:friends
     staff
     johnson:project-team
   Members of smith:friends (id: -562) are:
     pat
     terry
     jones
     richard
     thompson

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The required privilege depends on the setting of the third privacy flag in
the Protection Database entry of each user or group indicated by the
B<-nameorid> argument (use the B<pts examine> command to
display the flags):

=over 4

=item *

If it is the hyphen and the -nameorid argument specifies a
user, only the associated user and members of the
B<system:administrators> group can list the groups to which the
user belongs.


=item *

If it is the hyphen and the -nameorid argument specifies a
machine, only the members of the B<system:administrators> group
can list the groups to which the machine belongs.


=item *

If it is the hyphen and the -nameorid argument specifies a
group, only the owner of the group and members of the
B<system:administrators> group can list the members of the
group.


=item *

If it is lowercase C<m> and the -nameorid argument
specifies a user or machine entry, the meaning is equivalent to the
hyphen.


=item *

If it is lowercase C<m> and the -nameorid argument
specifies a group, members of the group can also list the other
members.


=item *

If it is uppercase C<M>, anyone who can access the cell's
database server machines can list group memberships.
