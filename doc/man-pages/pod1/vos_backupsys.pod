=head1 DESCRIPTION

The vos backupsys command clones each indicated read/write
volume to create a backup version, placing each clone at the same site as its
read/write source version. It assigns each clone the same name as the
read/write source, adding a B<.backup> extension. It
assigns the volume ID number already allocated for the backup version in the
Volume Location Database (VLDB). If a backup version already exists for
a given volume, the new clone replaces it.

To clone every read/write volume listed in the VLDB, omit all of the
command's options. Otherwise, combine the command's options
to clone various groups of volumes. The options use one of two basic
criteria to select volumes: location (the B<-server> and
B<-partition> arguments) or presence in the volume name of one of a
set of specified character strings (the B<-prefix>,
B<-exclude>, and B<-xprefix> options).

To clone only volumes that reside on one file server machine, include the
B<-server> argument. To clone only volumes that reside on one
partition, combine the B<-server> and B<-partition>
arguments. The B<-partition> argument can also be used alone to
clone volumes that reside on the indicated partition on every file server
machine. These arguments can be combined with those that select volumes
based on their names.

Combine the B<-prefix>, -exclude, and
B<-xprefix> options (with or without the B<-server> and
B<-partition> arguments) in the indicated ways to select volumes based
on character strings contained in their names:

=over 4

=item *

To clone every read/write volume at the specified location whose name
includes one of a set of specified character strings (for example, begins with
B<user.> or includes the string B<afs>), use the
B<-prefix> argument or combine the B<-xprefix> and
B<-exclude> options.


=item *

To clone every read/write volume at the specified location except those
whose name includes one of a set of specified character strings, use the
B<-xprefix> argument or combine the B<-prefix> and
B<-exclude> options.


=item *

To clone every read/write volume at the specified location whose name
includes one of one of a set of specified character strings, except those
whose names include one of a different set of specified character strings,
combine the B<-prefix> and B<-xprefix> arguments. The
command creates a list of all volumes that match the B<-prefix>
argument and then removes from the list the volumes that match the
B<-xprefix> argument. For effective results, the strings
specified by the B<-xprefix> argument must designate a subset of the
volumes specified by the B<-prefix> argument.


If the B<-exclude> flag is combined with the -prefix and
B<-xprefix> arguments, the command creates a list of all volumes that
do not match the B<-prefix> argument and then adds to the list any
volumes that match the B<-xprefix> argument. As when the
B<-exclude> flag is not used, the result is effective only if the
strings specified by the B<-xprefix> argument designate a subset of
the volumes specified by the B<-prefix> argument.

=back

The B<-prefix> and -xprefix arguments both accept
multiple values, which can be used to define disjoint groups of
volumes. Each value can be one of two types:

=item *

A simple character string, which matches volumes whose name begin with the
string. All characters are interpreted literally (that is, characters
that potentially have special meaning to the command shell, such as the
period, have only their literal meaning).


=item *

A regular expression, which matches volumes whose names contain the
expressions. Place a caret ( B<^> ) at the
beginning of the expression, and enclose the entire string in single quotes
(B<'> B<'>). Explaining regular
expressions is outside the scope of this reference page; see the UNIX
manual page for B<regexp(5)> or (for a brief introduction) the
B<backup addvolentry> reference page in this document. As an
example, the following expression matches volumes that have the string
B<aix> anywhere in their names:


   -prefix  '^.*aix'

To display a list of the volumes to be cloned, without actually cloning
them, include the B<-dryrun> flag. To display a statement that
summarizes the criteria being used to select volume, include the
B<-verbose> flag.

This command can be used to clone a single read/write volume; specify
its complete name as the B<-prefix> argument. However, it is
more efficient to use the B<vos backup> command, which employs a more
streamlined technique for finding a single volume.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -prefix

Specifies one or more simple character strings or regular expressions of
any length; a volume whose name includes the string is placed on the set
of volumes to be cloned. Include field separators (such as periods) if
appropriate. This argument can be combined with any combination of the
B<-server>, B<-partition>, B<-exclude>, and
B<-xprefix> options.

=item -server

Identifies the file server machine where each read/write source volume
resides. Provide the machine's IP address or its host name (either
fully qualified or using an unambiguous abbreviation). For details, see
the introductory reference page for the B<vos> command suite. 

This argument can be combined with any combination of the
B<-prefix>, B<-partition>, B<-exclude>, and
B<-xprefix> options.

=item -partition
>

Identifies the partition where each read/write source volume
resides. Provide the partition's complete name with preceding
slash (for example, B</vicepa>) or use one of the three acceptable
abbreviated forms. For details, see the introductory reference page for
the B<vos> command suite. 

This argument can be combined with any combination of the
B<-prefix>, B<-server>, B<-exclude>, and
B<-xprefix> options.

=item -exclude

Reverses the meaning of the B<-prefix> or -xprefix
argument. This flag can be combined with any combination of the
B<-prefix>, B<-server>, B<-partition>, and
B<-xprefix> options.

=item -xprefix

Specifies a simple character string or regular expression of any
length; a volume whose name includes the string is removed from the set
of volumes to be cloned. Include field separators (such as periods) if
appropriate. This argument can be combined with any combination of the
B<-prefix>, B<-server>, B<-partition>, and
B<-exclude> options.

=item -dryrun

Displays on the standard output stream a list of the volumes to be cloned,
without actually cloning them.

=item -cell

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see the
introductory B<vos> reference page.

=item -noauth

Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the
issuer. Do not combine this flag with the B<-localauth>
flag. For more details, see the introductory B<vos> reference
page.

=item -localauth

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<vos> command
interpreter presents it to the Volume Server and Volume Location Server during
mutual authentication. Do not combine this flag with the
B<-cell> argument or B<-noauth> flag. For more details,
see the introductory B<vos> reference page.

=item -verbose

Produces on the standard output stream a detailed trace of the
command's execution. If this argument is omitted, only warnings
and error messages appear.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

The command generates the following messages on the standard output stream
to confirm that the operation was successful:

   done
   Total volumes backed up: I<number_cloned>; failed to backup: I<failures>

If the -dryrun flag is included, a list of the volumes to be
backed up precedes the standard confirmation messages.

If the B<-verbose> flag is included but not the -dryrun
flag, the following messages appear for each volume. The output
concludes with the standard confirmation messages.

   Creating backup volume for I<volume_name> on I<date/time>
   {Recloning backup volume | Creating a new backup clone} I<backup_volumeID> . . .done

If both the B<-dryrun> and -verbose flags are included,
the output begins with a statement summarizing the criteria being used to
select the volumes, followed by a list of the volumes and the standard
confirmation messages. The format of the criteria summary statement
depends on which other options are provided:

=over 4

=item *

If only the -prefix argument is provided, or the
B<-xprefix> and B<-exclude> options are combined:


   Would have backed up volumes which are prefixed with I<string> [orI<string>] . .

=item *

If only the -xprefix argument is provided, or the
B<-prefix> and B<-exclude> options are combined:


   Would have backed up volumes which are not prefixed with I<string> [norI<string>] . .

=item *

If the B<-prefix> and -xprefix arguments are
combined:


   Would have backed up volumes which are prefixed with I<string> [orI<string>]  \
      removing those which are prefixed with  I<x_string> [orI<x_string>] . .

=item *

If the B<-prefix>, B<-xprefix>, and -exclude
options are provided:


   Would have backed up volumes which are not prefixed with I<string> [norI<string>]  \
      adding those which are prefixed with  I<x_string> [orI<x_string>] . .

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example creates a backup version of every read/write volume
listed in the cell's VLDB whose name begins with the string
B<user>.

   % vos backupsys -prefix user

The following example, appropriate in the ABC Corporation cell, creates a
backup version of every read/write volume on the file server machine
B<fs3.abc.com>.

   % vos backupsys -server fs3.abc.com

The following example, appropriate in the State University cell, creates a
backup version of every read/write volume on the file server machine
B<db1.stateu.edu> except those whose name includes the
string B<temp>.

   % vos backupsys  -server db1.stateu.edu -prefix '^.*temp'

The following example creates a backup version of every volume listed in
the cell's VLDB, excluding those whose names contain the string
B<source>, but including those whose names contain the string
B<source.current>.

   % vos backupsys  -prefix '^.*source' -exclude -xprefix '^.*source\.current'

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the /usr/afs/etc/UserList file on
the machine specified with the B<-server> argument and on each
database server machine. If the B<-localauth> flag is included,
the issuer must instead be logged on to a server machine as the local
superuser B<root>.
