=head1 NAME

fs newcell - Changes the kernel-resident list of a cell's database server machines

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<fs newcell -name> <I<cell name>> -servers <I<primary servers>>+
[B<-linkedcell> <I<linked cell name>>]  [B<-help>]

B<fs n -n> <I<cell name>>  B<-s> <I<primary servers>>+  [B<-l> <I<linked cell name>>]  [-h]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The fs newcell command removes the Cache Manager's
kernel-resident list of database server machines for the cell specified by the
B<-name> argument and replaces it with the database server machines
named by the B<-servers> argument.

Each time the machine reboots, the Cache Manager constructs the kernel list
of cells and database server machines by reading the local
B</usr/vice/etc/CellServDB> file. This command does not change
the B<CellServDB> file, so any changes made with it persist only until
the next reboot, unless the issuer also edits the file. The output of
the B<fs listcells> command reflects changes made with this command,
because that command consults the kernel-resident list rather than the
B<CellServDB> file.

This command can introduce a completely new cell into the kernel-resident
list, but cannot make a cell inaccessible (it is not possible to remove a
cell's entry from the kernel-resident list by providing no values for the
B<-server> argument). To make a cell inaccessible, remove its
entry from the B<CellServDB> file and reboot the machine.

If the -name argument names a DCE cell, then the
B<-servers> argument names DFS Fileset Location (FL) Server
machines. The B<-linkedcell> argument specifies the name of the
AFS cell to link to a DCE cell for the purpose of DFS fileset location.
Refer to the I<IBM AFS/DFS Migration Toolkit Administration Guide and
Reference> for more information on linking AFS clients to DCE cells using
this command or by editing the B</usr/vice/etc/CellServDB>
file.

=head1 CAVEATS

Some commands, such as the klog command, work correctly only
when the information is accurate for a cell in both the B<CellServDB>
file and the kernel-resident list.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -name

Specifies the fully-qualified cell name of the AFS or DCE cell.

=item -servers

Specifies the fully-qualified hostnames of all AFS database server
machines or DFS Fileset Location (FL) Server machines for the cell named by
the B<-name> argument. If FL Server machines are specified, the
local machine must be running the AFS/DFS Migration Toolkit Protocol
Translator.

=item -linkedcell

Specifies the name of the AFS cell to link to a DCE cell for the purpose
of DFS fileset location.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example changes the machine's kernel-resident list of
database server machines for the ABC Corporation cell to include the machines
B<db1.abc.com> and
B<db2.abc.com>:

   % fs newcell -name abc.com -servers db1.abc.com db2.abc.com

The following example links the DCE cell
B<dce.abc.com> to the AFS cell
B<abc.com>. The AFS client contacts the Fileset Location
(FL) servers B<db1.dce.abc.com> and
B<db2.dce.abc.com> for fileset location
information as it interprets a DFS pathname.

   % fs newcell -name dce.abc.com -servers db1.dce.abc.com db2.dce.abc.com   \
                -linkedcell abc.com

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be logged in as the local superuser root.
