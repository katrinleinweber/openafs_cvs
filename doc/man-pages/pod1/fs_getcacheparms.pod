=head1 NAME

fs getcacheparms - Displays the current size of the cache and the amount being used

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<fs getcacheparms> [-help]

B<fs getca> [-h]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The fs getcacheparms command displays the current size of the
cache (which can be in memory or on disk), and the amount currently in
use.

The reported statistics are from kernel memory, so the reported size can
differ from the setting specified in the B</usr/vice/etc/cacheinfo>
file on a machine using a disk cache, if the B<fs setcachesize>
command has been used to alter cache size.

are ignored.

=head1 OUTPUT

where I<amount used> is the number of kilobyte blocks currently used
to cache data and status information, and I<size> is the total current
cache size.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example shows the output on a machine with a 25000 kilobyte
cache.

   % fs getcacheparms
   AFS using 22876 of the cache's available 25000 1K byte blocks.
