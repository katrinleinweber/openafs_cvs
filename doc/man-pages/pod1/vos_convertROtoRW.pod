=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<vos convertROtoRW> converts a Read-Only volume into a Read/Write volume
when the original Read/Write volume is no longer available.  It's normal use
is to recover the Read/Write volume from a replica after a failed disk,
failed server, or accidental deletion.

=head1 CAUTIONS

This command can only be used with namei AFS file servers.  If used on an
inode AFS file server, it will fail with an error.

The command name is case-sensitive.  It must be issued with the capital "RO"
and "RW".

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<server name>>

Identifies the file server machine that houses the Read-Only volume which
will be converted.  Provide the machine's IP address or its host name
(either fully qualified or using an unambiguous abbreviation).  For details,
see L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-partition> <I<partition name>>

Identifies the partition on the file server machine that houses the
Read-Only volume which will be converted.  Provide the full partition name
(for, example, B</vicepa>) or one of the abbreviated forms described in
L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-id> <I<volume ID>>

Specifies either the complete name or volume ID number of a Read/Write
volume.

=item B<-force>

Don't ask for confirmation.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity C<anonymous> to the issuer. Do not
combine this flag with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see
L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<vos> command interpreter presents it
to the Volume Server and Volume Location Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> argument or
B<-noauth> flag. For more details, see L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-verbose>

Produces on the standard output stream a detailed trace of the command's
execution. If this argument is omitted, only warnings and error messages
appear.

=item B<-encrypt>

Encrypts the command so that the operation's results are not transmitted
across the network in clear text.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example converts the read-only volume test3.readonly in
partition vicepb on server1 to a read-write volume:

   % vos convertROtoRW server1 b test3.readonly

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machines specified with the B<-toserver> and B<-fromserver> arguments and
on each database server machine.  If the B<-localauth> flag is included,
the issuer must instead be logged on to a server machine as the local
superuser C<root>.
