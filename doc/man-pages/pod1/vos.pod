vos - Introduction to the vos command suite

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The commands in the vos command suite are the administrative
interface to the Volume Server and Volume Location (VL) Server. System
administrators use B<vos> commands to create, move, delete, replicate,
back up and examine volumes, among other operations. The VL Server
automatically records in the Volume Location Database (VLDB) changes in volume
status and location that result from B<vos> commands.

The operations invoked by most vos commands are idempotent,
meaning that if an operation is interrupted by a network, server machine, or
process outage, then a subsequent attempt at the same operation continues from
the interruption point, rather than starting over at the beginning of the
operation. Before executing a command, the Volume and VL Servers check
the current state of the volumes and VLDB records to be altered by the
command. If they are already in the desired end state (or a consistent
intermediate state), there is no need to repeat the internal steps that
brought them there. Idempotency does not apply if the command issuer
explicitly interrupts the operation with the <B<Ctrl-c>> command or
another interrupt signal. In that case, the volume is left locked and
the administrator must use the B<vos unlock> command to unlock it
before proceeding.

It is important that the VLDB accurately indicate the status of the volumes
on file server machines at all times. The reference pages for the files
B<vldb.DB0> and
B<V>I<vol_ID>B<.vol> describe the information
recorded in the VLDB and volume headers, respectively. If a
B<vos> command changes volume status, it automatically records the
change in the corresponding VLDB entry. The most common cause of
discrepancies between the VLDB and volume status on file server machines is
interrupted operations; to restore consistency, use the B<vos
syncserv> and B<vos syncvldb> commands.

There are several categories of commands in the vos command
suite:

B<vos listpart> and B<vos partinfo>


=item *

B<vos syncserv> and B<vos syncvldb>


=item *

Commands to lock and unlock VLDB entries: vos lock,
B<vos unlock>, and B<vos unlockvldb>


=item *

A command to report Volume Server status: vos status


=item *

Commands to obtain help: B<vos apropos> and vos
help

=head1 OPTIONS

The following arguments and flags are available on many commands in the
B<bos> suite. The reference page for each command also lists
them, but they are described here in greater detail.

=over 4

=item -cell <I<cell name>
>

Names the cell in which to run the command. It is acceptable to
abbreviate the cell name to the shortest form that distinguishes it from the
other entries in the B</usr/vice/etc/CellServDB> file on the local
machine. If the B<-cell> argument is omitted, the command
interpreter determines the name of the local cell by reading the following in
order: 

=item *

The value of the AFSCELL environment variable


=item *

The local /usr/vice/etc/ThisCell file


Do not combine the B<-cell> and -localauth
options. A command on which the B<-localauth> flag is included
always runs in the local cell (as defined in the server machine's local
B</usr/afs/etc/ThisCell> file), whereas a command on which the
B<-cell> argument is included runs in the specified foreign
cell.

=item -help

Prints a command's online help message on the standard output
stream. Do not combine this flag with any of the command's other
options; when it is provided, the command interpreter ignores all other
options, and only prints the help message.

=item -localauth

Constructs a server ticket using the server encryption key with the
highest key version number in the local B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile>
file. The B<vos> command interpreter presents the ticket, which
never expires, to the Volume Server and VL Server during mutual
authentication. 

Use this flag only when issuing a command on a server machine; client
machines do not usually have a B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file.
The issuer of a command that includes this flag must be logged on to the
server machine as the local superuser B<root>. The flag is
useful for commands invoked by an unattended application program, such as a
process controlled by the UNIX B<cron> utility or by a cron entry in
the machine's B</usr/afs/local/BosConfig> file. It is also
useful if an administrator is unable to authenticate to AFS but is logged in
as the local superuser B<root>. 

Do not combine the B<-cell> and -localauth
options. A command on which the B<-localauth> flag is included
always runs in the local cell (as defined in the server machine's local
B</usr/afs/etc/ThisCell> file), whereas a command on which the
B<-cell> argument is included runs in the specified foreign
cell. Also, do not combine the B<-localauth> and
B<-noauth> flags.

=item -noauth

Establishes an unauthenticated connection to the Volume Server and VL
Server, in which the servers treat the issuer as the unprivileged user
B<anonymous>. It is useful only when authorization checking is
disabled on the server machine (during the installation of a file server
machine or when the B<bos setauth> command has been used during other
unusual circumstances). In normal circumstances, the servers allow only
privileged users to issue commands that change the status of a volume or VLDB
record, and refuses to perform such an action even if the B<-noauth>
flag is provided. Do not combine the B<-noauth> and
B<-localauth> flags.

=item -partition <I<partition name>
>

Identifies the AFS server partition on a file server machine that houses,
or is to house, the volumes of interest, or about which to list
information. The B<vos> command interpreter accepts any of the
following four name formats: 

   B</vicepa>     =     B<vicepa>      =      B<a>      =      0
   B</vicepb>     =     B<vicepb>      =      B<b>      =      1

After /vicepz (for which the index is 25) comes 

   B</vicepaa>    =     B<vicepaa>     =      B<aa>     =      26
   B</vicepab>    =     B<vicepab>     =      B<ab>     =      27

and so on through 

   B</vicepiv>    =     B<vicepiv>     =      B<iv>     =      255

The B<-frompartition> and -topartition arguments to the
B<vos move> command also accept this notation.

=item -server <I<machine name>
>

Identifies the file server machine that houses, or is to house, the
volumes or AFS server partitions of interest. Provide the
machine's IP address in dotted decimal format, its fully qualified host
name (for example, B<fs1.abc.com>), or the shortest
abbreviated form of its host name that distinguishes it from other
machines. Successful use of an abbreviated form depends on the
availability of a name resolution service (such as the Domain Name Service or
a local host table) at the time the command is issued.

The B<-fromserver> and -toserver arguments to the
B<vos move> command also accept these name formats.

=item -verbose

Produces on the standard output stream a detailed trace of the
command's execution. If this argument is omitted, only warnings
and error messages appear.

=back

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

To issue most vos commands, the issuer must be listed in the
B</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on each server machine that houses or is
to house an affected volume, and on each database server machine. The
most predictable performance results if all database server and file server
machines in the cell share a common B<UserList> file.
Alternatively, if the B<-localauth> flag is included, the issuer must
be logged on to a server machine as the local superuser
B<root>.

To issue a vos command that only displays information, no
privilege is required.
