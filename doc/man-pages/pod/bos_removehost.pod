=head1 NAME

bos removehost - Removes a database server machine from the B</usr/afs/etc/CellServDB>
file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

bos removehost B<-server> I<machine name>  B<-host> I<host name> [I<host name> ...]
[B<-cell> I<cell name>]  [B<-noauth>]  [B<-localauth>]  [B<-help>]

bos removeh B<-s> I<machine name>  B<-ho> I<host name> [I<host name> ...]  [B<-c> I<cell name>]
[B<-n>]  [B<-l>]  [B<-he>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<bos removehost> command removes the entry for each database server
machine specified with the B<-host> argument from the
B</usr/afs/etc/CellServDB> file on the server machine named by the
B<-server> argument.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> I<machine name>

Indicates the server machine on which to change the
B</usr/afs/etc/CellServDB> file. Identify the machine by IP
address or its host name (either fully-qualified or abbreviated
unambiguously). For details, see the introductory reference
page for the C<bos> command suite.

In cells that run the United States edition of AFS and use the
Update Server to distribute the contents of the B</usr/afs/etc>
directory, it is conventional to specify only the system
control machine as a value for the B<-server> argument. In cells
that run the international version of AFS, repeat the command
for each file server machine. For further discussion, see the
introductory reference page for the C<bos> command suite.

=item B<-host> I<host name> [I<host name> ...]

Specifies the fully-qualified host name (such as B<fs2.abc.com>)
of each database server machine to remove from the B<CellServDB>
file.

=item B<-cell> I<cell name>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see the
introductory L<bos(1)> reference page.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity B<anonymous> to the issuer. Do
not combine this flag with the B<-localauth> flag. For more
details, see the introductory L<bos(1)> reference page.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The C<bos> command interpreter presents
the ticket to the BOS Server during mutual authentication. Do
not combine this flag with the B<-cell> or B<-noauth> options. For
more details, see the introductory L<bos(1)> reference page.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid
options are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command removes the former database server machine
B<db2.abc.com> from the B<CellServDB> file on the system control machine
B<fs1.abc.com>.

    bos removehost -server fs1.abc.com -host db2.abc.com

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the B</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine named by the B<-server> argument, or must be logged onto a server
machine as the local superuser B<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is
included.

=head1 CAVEATS

After executing this command (and waiting for the Update Server to
propagate the changes, if it is used), restart the database server
processes on all database server machines to force election of a
quorum that includes the new set of machines listed in the
B</usr/afs/etc/CellServDB> file. The IBM AFS Quick Beginnings explains in
more detail how to add and remove database server machines.
