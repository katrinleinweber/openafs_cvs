=head1 NAME

bos stop - Stops a process after changing its status flag in the
B</usr/afs/local/BosConfig> file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

bos stop B<-server> I<machine name>  B<-instance> I<server process name> [I<server process name> ...]
[B<-wait>]  [B<-cell> I<cell name>]  [B<-noauth>]  [B<-localauth>]  [B<-help>]

bos sto B<-s> I<machine name>  B<-i> I<server process name> [I<server process name> ...]
[B<-w>]  [B<-c> I<cell name>]  [B<-n>]  [B<-l>]  [B<-h>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<bos stop> command sets the status flag for each process specified
with the B<-instance> argument to C<NotRun> in the B</usr/afs/local/BosConfig>
file on the server machine named by the B<-server> argument, then stops
it.

To stop a process without changing its B<BosConfig> status flag, use the
C<bos shutdown> command instead.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> I<machine name>

Indicates the server machine on which to stop processes.
Identify the machine by IP address or its host name (either
fully-qualified or abbreviated unambiguously). For details, see
the introductory reference page for the C<bos> command suite.

=item B<-instance> I<server process name> [I<server process name> ...]

Names each process to stop. Use the process name assigned with
the B<-instance> argument to the C<bos create> command. The output
from the C<bos status> command lists the names.

=item B<-wait>

Delays the return of the command shell prompt until all
processes actually stop. If this argument is omitted, the
prompt returns almost immediately even if all processes are not
stopped.

=item B<-cell> I<cell name>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see the
introductory L<bos(1)> reference page.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity B<anonymous> to the issuer. Do
not combine this flag with the B<-localauth> flag. For more
details, see the introductory L<bos(1)> reference page.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The C<bos> command interpreter presents
the ticket to the BOS Server during mutual authentication. Do
not combine this flag with the B<-cell> or B<-noauth> options. For
more details, see the introductory L<bos(1)> reference page.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid
options are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example command stops the B<upserver> and B<runntp> on the
machine B<fs7.abc.com>.

    bos stop -server fs7.abc.com -instance upserver runntp

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the B</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine named by the B<-server> argument, or must be logged onto a server
machine as the local superuser B<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is
included.
