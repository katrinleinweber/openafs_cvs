<DL>
<P><DT><B><B>a (administer) Permission</B>
</B><DD>The ACL permission that allows the possessor to change the entries on the
ACL .
<P><DT><B><B>a Privacy Flag</B>
</B><DD>The fourth privacy flag on a group, which enables the possessor to add
members to it.
<P><DT><B><B>Access Control List (ACL)</B>
</B><DD>A list associated with an AFS directory that specifies what actions a user
or group can perform on the directory and the files in it. There are
seven access permissions: <B>a</B> (<B>administer</B>),
<B>d</B> (<B>delete</B>), <B>i</B> (<B>insert</B>),
<B>k</B> (<B>lock</B>), <B>l</B> (<B>lookup</B>), <B>r</B>
(<B>read</B>), and <B>w</B> (<B>write</B>).
<P><DT><B><B>ACL Entry</B>
</B><DD>An entry on an ACL that pairs a user or group with specific access
permissions.
<P><DT><B><B>Alias</B>
</B><DD>An alternative name for an AFS command.
<P><DT><B><B>all ACL Shorthand</B>
</B><DD>A shorthand notation used with the <B>fs setacl</B> command to
represent all seven permissions.
<P><DT><B><B>Anonymous</B>
</B><DD>The identity assigned to a user who does not have a valid token for the
local cell.
<P><DT><B><B>Argument</B>
</B><DD>The portion of a command that names an entity to be affected by the
command. Arguments consist of two parts: a <I>switch</I> and
one or more <I>instances</I>. Some AFS commands take one or more
arguments.
<P><DT><B><B>Authenticate</B>
</B><DD>To become recognized as a valid AFS user by providing the correct
password. Authenticate by logging onto a machine that uses an
AFS-modified login utility or by issuing the <B>klog</B> command.
Only authenticated users can perform most AFS actions.
<P><DT><B><B>Byte, kilobyte</B>
</B><DD>A unit of measure used to measure usage of space in a volume or on a
partition. A kilobyte block is equal to 1024 bytes.
<P><DT><B><B>Cache Manager</B>
</B><DD>A set of modifications to the operating system on a client machine which
enables users on the machine to access files stored in AFS. The Cache
Manager requests files from the File Server and stores (<I>caches</I>) a
copy of each file on the client machine's local disk. Application
programs then use the cached copy, which eliminates repeated network requests
to file server machines.
<P><DT><B><B>Cached File</B>
</B><DD>A copy of a file that the Cache Manager stores on a workstation's
local disk.
<P><DT><B><B>Callback</B>
</B><DD>A promise from the File Server to contact the Cache Manager if the
centrally stored copy of the file changes while the Cache Manager has a cached
copy. If the file is altered, the File Server <I>breaks</I> the
callback. The next time an application program asks for data from the
file, the Cache Manager notices the broken callback and retrieves an updated
copy of the file from the File Server. Callbacks ensure the user is
working with the most recent copy of a file.

of file server machines and client machines defined to belong to the
cell. A machine can belong to only one cell at a time.

server machines) perform different specialized functions.

all machines.
