<HR><H1><A NAME="HDRWQ60" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_112">Using Groups</A></H1>
<P>This chapter explains how to create groups and discusses
different ways to use them.
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ61" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_113">About Groups</A></H2>
<P>An AFS <I>group</I> is a list of specific users that you
can place on access control lists (ACLs). Groups make it much easier to
maintain ACLs. Instead of creating an ACL entry for every user
individually, you create one entry for a group to which the users
belong. Similarly, you can grant a user access to many directories at
once by adding the user to a group that appears on the relevant ACLs.
<P>AFS client machines can also belong to a group. Anyone logged into
the machine inherits the permissions granted to the group on an ACL, even if
they are not authenticated with AFS. In general, groups of machines are
useful only to system administrators, for specialized purposes like complying
with licensing agreements your cell has with software vendors. Talk
with your system administrator before putting a client machine in a group or
using a machine group on an ACL. 
<A NAME="IDX1025"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1026"></A>
<P>To learn about AFS file protection and how to add groups to ACLs, see <A HREF="auusg007.htm#HDRWQ44">Protecting Your Directories and Files</A>.
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ62" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_114">Suggestions for Using Groups Effectively</A></H3>
<P>There are three typical ways to use groups, each suited to a
particular purpose: private use, shared use, and group use. The
following are only suggestions. You are free to use groups in any way
you choose.
<UL>
<P><LI><I>Private use</I>: you create a group and place it on the ACL
of directories you own, without necessarily informing the group's members
that they belong to it. Members notice only that they can or cannot
access the directory in a certain way. You retain sole administrative
control over the group, since you are the owner.
<A NAME="IDX1027"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1028"></A>
<P>The existence of the group and the identity of its members is not
necessarily secret. Other users can see the group's name on an ACL
when they use the <B>fs listacl</B> command, and can use the <B>pts
membership</B> command to display + the groups to which they themselves
belong. You can, however, limit who can display the members of the
group, as described in <A HREF="#HDRWQ74">Protecting Group-Related Information</A>.
<P><LI><I>Shared use</I>: you inform the group's members that they
belong to the group, but you are the group's sole owner and
administrator. For example, the manager of a work group can create a
group of all the members in the work group, and encourage them to use it on
the ACLs of directories that house information they want to share with other
members of the group. 
<A NAME="IDX1029"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1030"></A>
<TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><B>Note:</B></TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">If you place a group owned by someone else on your ACLs, the group's
owner can change the group's membership without informing you.
Someone new can gain or lose access in a way you did not intend and without
your knowledge.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><LI><I>Group use</I>: you create a group and then use the <B>pts
chown</B> command to assign ownership to a group--either another group
or the group itself (the latter type is a <I>self-owned</I> group).
You inform the members of the owning group that they all can administer the
owned group. For instructions for the <B>pts chown</B> command, see
<A HREF="#HDRWQ73">To Change a Group's Owner</A>.
<A NAME="IDX1031"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1032"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1033"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1034"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1035"></A>
<P>The main advantage of designating a group as an owner is that several
people share responsibility for administering the group. A single
person does not have to perform all administrative tasks, and if the
group's original owner leaves the cell, there are still other people who
can administer it.
<P>However, everyone in the owner group can make changes that affect others
negatively: adding or removing people from the group inappropriately or
changing the group's ownership to themselves exclusively. These
problems can be particularly sensitive in a self-owned group. Using an
owner group works best if all the members know and trust each other; it
is probably wise to keep the number of people in an owner group small.
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ63" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_115">Group Names</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX1036"></A>
<P>The groups you create must have names with two parts, in the following
format:
<P><VAR>   owner_name</VAR><B>:</B><VAR>group_name</VAR>
<P>The <VAR>owner_name</VAR> prefix indicates which user or group owns the group
(naming rules appear in <A HREF="#HDRWQ69">To Create a Group</A>). The <VAR>group_name</VAR> part indicates the
group's purpose or its members' common interest. Group names
must always be typed in full, so a short <VAR>group_name</VAR> is most
practical. However, names like <B>terry:1</B> and
<B>terry:2</B> that do not indicate the group's purpose are
less useful than names like <B>terry:project</B>.
<P>Groups that do not have the <VAR>owner_name</VAR> prefix possibly appear on
some ACLs; they are created by system administrators only. All of
the groups you create must have an <VAR>owner_name</VAR> prefix.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_116" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_116">Group-creation Quota</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX1037"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1038"></A>
<P>By default, you can create 20 groups, but your system administrators can
change your <I>group-creation quota</I> if appropriate. When you
create a group, your group quota decrements by one. When a group that
you created is deleted, your quota increments by one, even if you are no
longer the owner. You cannot increase your quota by transferring
ownership of a group to someone else, because you are always recorded as the
creator.
<P>If you exhaust your group-creation quota and need to create more groups,
ask your system administrator. For instructions for displaying your
group-creation quota, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ67">To Display A Group Entry</A>.

<P>You can change the owner or name of a group that you own (either directly

instructions in <A HREF="#HDRWQ70">To Add Members to a Group</A>.

<P>Each flag can take three possible types of values to enable a different set
of users to issue the corresponding command:

<P><LI>A hyphen (<B>-</B>) means that the group's owner can issue the
command, along with the administrators who belong to the
<B>system:administrators</B> group.
<P><LI>The lowercase version of the letter means that members of the group can
issue the command, along with the users indicated by the hyphen.
<P><LI>The uppercase version of the letter means that anyone can issue the
command.
</UL>
<P>For example, the flags <TT>SOmar</TT> on a group entry indicate that
anyone can examine the group's entry and list the groups that it owns,
and that only the group's members can list, add, or remove its
members.
<P>The default privacy flags for groups are <TT>S-M--</TT>, meaning that
