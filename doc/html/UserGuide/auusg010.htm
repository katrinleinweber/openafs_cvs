Some cells use the Network File System (NFS) in addition to AFS. If you
work on an NFS client machine, your system administrator can configure it to
access the AFS filespace through a program called the <I>NFS/AFS
Translator</I><SUP>TM</SUP>. If you have an AFS account, you can
access AFS as an authenticated user while working on your NFS client
machine. Otherwise, you access AFS as the <B>anonymous</B>
user.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1139"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1140"></A>
For you to use the NFS/AFS Translator, your system administrator must
configure the following types of machines as indicated:
<UL>
<P><LI>An <I>NFS/AFS translator machine</I> is an AFS client machine that
also acts as an NFS server machine. Its Cache Manager acts as the
surrogate Cache Manager for your NFS client machine. Ask your system
administrator which translator machines you can use.
<P><LI>Your NFS client machine must have an NFS mount to a translator
machine. Most often, your system administrator mounts the translator
machine's <B>/afs</B> directory and names the mount <B>/afs</B>
as well. This enables you to access the entire AFS filespace using
standard AFS pathnames. It is also possible to create mounts directly
to subdirectories of <B>/afs</B>, and to give NFS mounts different names
on the NFS client machine.
</UL>
<P>Your access to AFS is much more extensive if you have an AFS user
account. If you do not, the AFS servers recognize you as the
<B>anonymous</B> user and only grant you the access available to members
of the <B>system:anyuser</B> group.
<P>If your NFS client machine uses an operating system that AFS supports, your
system administrator can configure it to enable you to issue many AFS commands
on the machine. Ask him or her about the configuration and which
commands you can issue.
<HR><H2><A NAME="Header_160" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_160">Accessing AFS via the Translator</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX1141"></A>
<P>If you do not have an AFS account or choose not to access AFS as an
authenticated user, then all you do to access AFS is provide the pathname of
the relevant file. Its ACL must grant the necessary permissions to the
<B>system:anyuser</B> group.
<P>If you have an AFS account and want to access AFS as an authenticated user,
the best method depends on whether your NFS machine is a supported
type. If it is, use the instructions in <A HREF="#HDRWQ82">To Authenticate on a Supported Operating System</A>. If it is not a supported type, use the
instructions in <A HREF="#HDRWQ83">To Authenticate on an Unsupported Operating System</A>.

<P><LI>Issue the <B>klog</B> command. For complete instructions, see <A HREF="auusg005.htm#HDRWQ29">To Authenticate with AFS</A>.

<P><LI><A NAME="LINFS-TELNET"></A>Establish a connection to the NFS/AFS translator machine
you are using (for example, using the <B>telnet</B> utility) and log onto
it using your AFS username (which is normally the same as your NFS
username).
<P><LI>If the NFS/AFS translator machine uses an AFS-modified login utility, then
you obtained AFS tokens in Step <A HREF="#LINFS-TELNET">2</A>. To check, issue the <B>tokens</B> command, which
is described fully in <A HREF="auusg005.htm#HDRWQ30">To Display Your Tokens</A>. 
<PRE>   % <B>tokens</B>
</PRE>If you do not have tokens, issue the <B>klog</B> command, which is

<P><LI><A NAME="LINFS-KNFS"></A>Issue the <B>knfs</B> command to associate your AFS
tokens with your UNIX UID on the NFS client machine where you are
working. This enables the Cache Manager on the translator machine to
use the tokens properly when you access AFS from the NFS client
machine. 
<P>If your NFS client machine is a system type for which AFS defines a system
name, it can make sense to add the <B>-sysname</B> argument. This
argument helps the Cache Manager access binaries specific to your NFS client
machine, if your system administrator has used the <I>@sys</I> variable in
pathnames. Ask your system administrator if this argument is useful for
you.

for assistance. Your system administrator can also explain the issues

<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ84" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_163">Troubleshooting the NFS/AFS Translator</A></H2>
<P>Acceptable performance by the NFS/AFS translator depends for
the most part on NFS. Sometimes, problems that appear to be AFS file
server outages, broken connections, or inaccessible files are actually caused
by NFS outages.
<P>This section describes some common problems and their possible
causes. If other problems arise, contact your system administrator, who
can ask the AFS Product Support group for assistance if necessary.
<TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><B>Note:</B></TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">To avoid degrading AFS performance, the Cache Manager on the translator
machine does not immediately send changes made on NFS client machines to the
File Server. Instead, it checks every 60 seconds for such changes and
sends them then. It can take longer for changes made on an NFS client
machine to be saved than for changes made on an AFS client machine. The
save operation must complete before the changes are visible on NFS client
machines that are using a different translator machine or on AFS client
machines.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ85" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_164">Your NFS Client Machine is Frozen</A></H3>
<P>If your system administrator has used the recommended options
when creating an NFS mount to an NFS/AFS translator machine, then the mount is
both <I>hard</I> and <I>interruptible</I>:
<UL>
<P><LI>A hard mount means that the NFS client retries its requests if it does not
receive a response within the expected time frame. This is useful
because requests have to pass through both the NFS and AFS client software,
which can sometimes take longer than the NFS client expects. However,
it means that if the NFS/AFS translator machine actually becomes inaccessible,
your NFS client machine can become inoperative (<I>freeze</I> or
<I>hang</I>).
<P><LI>If the NFS mount is interruptible, then in the case of an NFS/AFS
translator machine outage you can press &lt;<B>Ctrl-c</B>> or another
interrupt signal to halt the NFS client's repeated attempts to access
AFS. You can then continue to work locally, or can NFS-mount another
translator machine. If the NFS mount is not interruptible, you must
actually remove the mount to the inaccessible translator machine.
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_165" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_165">NFS/AFS Translator Reboots</A></H3>
<P>If you have authenticated to AFS and your translator machine reboots,
you must issue the <B>klog</B> command (and <B>knfs</B> command, if
appropriate) to reauthenticate. If you used the <B>knfs</B>
command's <B>-sysname</B> argument to define your NFS client
machine's system name, use it again.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_166" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_166">System Error Messages</A></H3>
<P>This section explains possible meanings for NFS error messages you
receive while accessing AFS filespace.
<P><TT>stale NFS client</TT>
<P><TT>Getpwd: can't read</TT>
<P>Both messages possibly means that your translator machine was rebooted and
cannot determine the pathname to the current working directory. To
reestablish the path, change directory and specify the complete pathname
starting with <B>/afs</B>.
<P><TT>NFS server <VAR>translator_machine</VAR> is not responding still
trying</TT>.
<P>The NFS client is not getting a response from the NFS/AFS translator
machine. If the NFS mount to the translator machine is a hard mount,
your NFS client continues retrying the request until it gets a response (see <A HREF="#HDRWQ85">Your NFS Client Machine is Frozen</A>). If the NFS mount to the translator machine is a
soft mount, the NFS client stops retrying after a certain number of attempts
(three by default).
