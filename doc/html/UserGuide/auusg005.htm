<HR><H1><A NAME="HDRWQ20" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_30">Using AFS</A></H1>
<P>This chapter explains how to perform four basic AFS
tasks: logging in and authenticating with AFS, ending an AFS session,
accessing the AFS filespace, and changing your password.
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ21" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_31">Logging in and Authenticating with AFS</A></H2>
<P>To access the AFS filespace as an authenticated user, you
must both log into an AFS client machine's local (UNIX) file system and
authenticate with AFS. When you log in, you establish your local system
identity. When you authenticate, you prove your identity to AFS and
obtain a token, which your Cache Manager uses to prove your authenticated
status to the AFS server processes it contacts on your behalf. Users
who are not authenticated (who do not have a token) have limited access to AFS
directories and files.
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ22" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_32">Logging In</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX819"></A>
<A NAME="IDX820"></A>
<A NAME="IDX821"></A>
<P>On machines that use an AFS-modified login utility, you log in and
authenticate in one step. On machines that do not use an AFS-modified
login utility, you log in and authenticate in separate steps. To
determine which type of login utility your machine uses, you can check for AFS
tokens after logging in, or ask your system administrator, who can also tell
you about any differences between your login procedure and the two methods
described here.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_33" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_33">To Log In Using an AFS-modified Login Utility</A></H3>
<P>Provide your username at the <TT>login:</TT> prompt that
appears when you establish a new connection to a machine. Then provide
your password at the <TT>Password:</TT> prompt as shown in the
following example. (Your password does not echo visibly on the
screen.) 
<PRE>   login: <VAR>username</VAR>
   Password: <VAR>password</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>If you are not sure which type of login utility is running on your machine,
it is best to issue the <B>tokens</B> command to check if you are
authenticated; for instructions, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ30">To Display Your Tokens</A>. If you do not have tokens, issue the <B>klog</B>
command as described in <A HREF="#HDRWQ29">To Authenticate with AFS</A>.

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ24" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_35">Authenticating with AFS</A></H3>
<P>To work most effectively in the AFS filespace, you must
authenticate with AFS. When you do, your Cache Manager is given a token
as proof of your authenticated status. It uses your token when
requesting services from AFS servers, which accept the token as proof of your
authenticated status. If you do not have a token, AFS servers consider
you to be the <B>anonymous</B> user and your access to AFS filespace is
limited: you have only the ACL permissions granted to the
<B>system:anyuser</B> group.
<A NAME="IDX822"></A>
<A NAME="IDX823"></A>
<A NAME="IDX824"></A>
<P>You can obtain new tokens (reauthenticate) at any time, even after using an
AFS-modified login utility, which logs you in and authenticates you in one
step. Issue the <B>klog</B> command as described in <A HREF="#HDRWQ29">To Authenticate with AFS</A>.
<P><H4><A NAME="HDRWQ25">Protecting Your Tokens with a PAG</A></H4>
<P>To make your access to AFS as secure as possible, it is best
to associate your tokens with a unique identification number called a
<I>PAG</I> (for <I>process authentication group</I>). 
<A NAME="IDX825"></A>
<A NAME="IDX826"></A>
<A NAME="IDX827"></A>
AFS-modified login utilities automatically create a PAG and associate the new
token with it. To create a PAG when you use the two-step login
procedure, include the <B>klog</B> command's <B>-setpag</B>
flag. If you do not use this flag, your tokens are associated with your
UNIX UID number instead. This type of association has two potential
drawbacks:
<UL>
<P><LI>Anyone who can assume your local UNIX identity can use your tokens.
The local superuser <B>root</B> can always use the UNIX <B>su</B>
command to assume your UNIX UID, even without knowing your password.
<P><LI>In some environments, certain programs cannot use your tokens even when it
is appropriate for them to do so. For example, printing commands such
as <B>lp</B> or <B>lpr</B> possibly cannot access the files you want
to print, because they cannot use your tokens.
</UL>
<P><H4><A NAME="HDRWQ26">Obtaining Tokens For Foreign Cells</A></H4>
<A NAME="IDX828"></A>
<P>A token is valid only in one cell (the cell whose AFS authentication
service issued it). The AFS server processes in any other cell consider
you to be the <B>anonymous</B> user unless you have an account in the cell
and authenticate with its AFS authentication service.
<P>To obtain tokens in a foreign cell, use the <B>-cell</B> argument to
the <B>klog</B> command. You can have tokens for your home cell and
one or more foreign cells at the same time.
<P><H4><A NAME="HDRWQ27">The One-Token-Per-Cell Rule</A></H4>
<P>You can have only one token per cell for each PAG you have
obtained on a client machine. If you already have a token for a
particular cell and issue the <B>klog</B> command, the new token
overwrites the existing one. Getting a new token is useful if your
current token is almost expired but you want to continue accessing AFS
files. For a discussion of token expiration, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ28">Token Lifetime</A>.
<P>To obtain a second token for the same cell, you must either login on a
different machine or establish another separate connection to the machine
where you already have a token (by using the <B>telnet</B> utility, for
example). You get a new PAG for each separate machine or connection,
and can use the associated tokens only while working on that machine or
connection.
<P><H4><A NAME="Header_39">Obtaining Tokens as Another User</A></H4>
<A NAME="IDX829"></A>
<P>You can authenticate as another username if you know the associated
password. (It is, of course, unethical to use someone else's
tokens without permission.) If you use the <B>klog</B> command to
authenticate as another AFS username, you retain your own local (UNIX)
identity, but the AFS server processes recognize you as the other user.
The new token replaces any token you already have for the relevant cell (for
the reason described in <A HREF="#HDRWQ27">The One-Token-Per-Cell Rule</A>).
<P><H4><A NAME="HDRWQ28">Token Lifetime</A></H4>
<A NAME="IDX830"></A>
<A NAME="IDX831"></A>
<P>Tokens have a limited lifetime. To determine when your tokens
expire, issue the <B>tokens</B> command as described in <A HREF="#HDRWQ30">To Display Your Tokens</A>. If you are ever unable to access AFS in a way that
you normally can, issuing the <B>tokens</B> command tells you whether an
expired token is a possible reason.
<P>Your cell's administrators set the default lifetime of your
token. The AFS authentication service never grants a token lifetime
longer than the default, but you can request a token with a shorter
lifetime. See the <B>klog</B> reference page in the <I>IBM AFS
Administration Reference</I> to learn how to use its <B>-lifetime</B>
argument for this purpose.

<A NAME="IDX835"></A>
<A NAME="IDX836"></A>
<P>If your machine is configured to access a DCE cell's DFS filespace by
means of the AFS/DFS Migration Toolkit, you can use the <B>dlog</B>
command to authenticate with DCE. The <B>dlog</B> command has no
effect on your ability to access AFS filespace.
<P>If your system administrator has converted your AFS account to a DCE
account and you are not sure of your DCE password, use the <B>dpass</B>
command to display it. You must be authenticated as the AFS user whose
AFS account was converted to a DCE account, and be able to provide the correct
AFS password. Like the <B>dlog</B> command, the <B>dpass</B>
command has no functionality with respect to AFS.
<P>For more information on using the <B>dlog</B> and <B>dpass</B>
commands, see your system administrator.

<A NAME="IDX848"></A>
<P>Your system administrator can choose to limit the number of times that you
fail to provide the correct password when authenticating with AFS (using
either an AFS-modified login utility or the <B>klog</B> command).
If you exceed the limit, the AFS authentication service refuses further
authentication attempts for a period of time set by your system
administrator. The purpose of this limit is to prevent unauthorized
users from breaking into your account by trying a series of passwords.
<P>To determine if your user account is subject to this limit, ask your system
administrator or issue the <B>kas examine</B> command as described in <A HREF="#HDRWQ32">To Display Your Failed Authentication Limit and Lockout Time</A>.
<P>The following message indicates that you have exceeded the limit on failed

does not necessarily destroy your tokens.
<P>You can use the <B>unlog</B> command any time you want to
unauthenticate, not just when logging out. For instance, it is a good
practice to unauthenticate before leaving your machine unattended, to prevent
other users from using your tokens during your absence. When you return

<A NAME="IDX861"></A>
<A NAME="IDX862"></A>
<P>While you are logged in and authenticated, you can access files in AFS just
as you do in the UNIX file system. The only difference is that you can
access potentially many more files. Just as in the UNIX file system,
you can only access those files for which you have permission. AFS uses
access control lists (ACLs) to control access, as described in <A HREF="auusg007.htm#HDRWQ44">Protecting Your Directories and Files</A>.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_54" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_54">AFS Pathnames</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX863"></A>
<P>AFS pathnames look very similar to UNIX file system names. The main
difference is that every AFS pathname begins with the AFS root directory,
which is called <B>/afs</B> by convention. Having <B>/afs</B>
at the top of every AFS cell's filespace links together their filespaces
into a global filespace.
<A NAME="IDX864"></A>
<A NAME="IDX865"></A>
<A NAME="IDX866"></A>
<A NAME="IDX867"></A>
<P><B>Note for Windows users:</B> Windows uses a backslash
(&nbsp;<B>\</B>&nbsp;) rather than a forward slash
(&nbsp;<B>/</B>&nbsp;) to separate the elements in a
pathname. Otherwise, your access to AFS filespace is much the same as
for users working on UNIX machines.
<P>The second element in AFS pathnames is generally a cell's name.
For example, the ABC Corporation cell is called <B>abc.com</B> and
the pathname of every file in its filespace begins with the string
<B>/afs/abc.com</B>. Some cells also create a directory at
the second level with a shortened name (such as <B>abc</B> for
<B>abc.com</B> or <B>stateu</B> for
<B>stateu.edu</B>), to reduce the amount of typing
necessary. Your system administrator can tell you if your cell's
filespace includes shortened names like this. The rest of the pathname
depends on how the cell's administrators organized its filespace.
<P>To access directories and files in AFS you must both specify the correct
pathname and have the required permissions on the ACL that protects the
directory and the files in it.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_55" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_55">Example:  Displaying the Contents of Another User's Directory</A></H3>

<A NAME="IDX868"></A>
<A NAME="IDX869"></A>
<P>You can access files not only in your own cell, but in any AFS cell that
you can reach via the network, regardless of geographical location.
There are two additional requirements:
<UL>
<P><LI>Your Cache Manager's list of foreign cells must include the cell you
want to access. Only the local superuser <B>root</B> can edit the
list of cells, but anyone can display it. See <A HREF="auusg006.htm#HDRWQ42">Determining Access to Foreign Cells</A>.
<P><LI>The ACL on the directory that houses the file, and on every parent
directory in the pathname, must grant you the necessary permissions.
The simplest way for the directory's owner to extend permission to
foreign users is to put an entry for the <B>system:anyuser</B> group
on the ACL. 
<P>The alternative is for the foreign cell's administrator to create an
account for you, essentially making you a local user in the cell. The
directory's owner creates an ACL entry for you as for any other local
user. To authenticate in the foreign cell, issue the <B>klog</B>
command with the <B>-cell</B> argument.

<P>In cells that use an AFS-modified login utility, the password
is the same for both logging in and authenticating with AFS. In this
case, you use a single command, <B>kpasswd</B>, to change the
password.
<P>If your machine does not use an AFS-modified login utility, there are
separate passwords for logging into the local file system and authenticating
with AFS. (The two passwords can be the same or different, at your
discretion.) In this case, use the <B>kpasswd</B> command to change
your AFS password and the UNIX <B>passwd</B> command to change your UNIX
password.
<P>Your system administrator can improve cell security by configuring several
features that guide your choice of password. Keep them in mind when you
issue the <B>kpasswd</B> command:
<UL>
<P><LI>Limiting the amount of time your password is valid. This improves
your cell's security by limiting the amount of time an unauthorized user
has to try to guess your password. Your system administrator needs to
tell you when your password is due to expire so that you can change it in
time. The administrator can configure the AFS-modified login utility to
report this information automatically each time you log in. You can
also use the <B>kas examine</B> command to display the password expiration
date, as instructed in <A HREF="#HDRWQ37">To Display Password Expiration Date and Reuse Policy</A>. 
<P>You can change your password prior to the expiration date, but your system
administrator can choose to set a minimum time between password
changes. The following message indicates that the minimum time has not
yet passed.
<PRE>   kpasswd:  password was not changed because you changed it too 
   recently; see your system administrator
</PRE>
<P><LI>Enforcing password quality standards, such as a minimum length or
inclusion of nonalphabetic characters. The administrator needs to tell
you about such requirements so that you do not waste time picking unacceptable
passwords.
<P><LI>Rejecting a password that is too similar to the last 20 passwords you
used. You can use the <B>kas examine</B> command to check whether
this policy applies to you, as instructed in <A HREF="#HDRWQ37">To Display Password Expiration Date and Reuse Policy</A>. The following message indicates that the password
you have chosen is too similar to a previous password. 
<PRE>   kpasswd:  Password was not changed because it seems like a reused password
