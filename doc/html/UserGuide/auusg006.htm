<P>By convention, the files in your home directory are stored
together in a single volume. (For information about volumes, see <A HREF="auusg004.htm#HDRWQ6">Volumes and Mount Points</A>.) To allocate your cell's available disk space
as fairly as possible, your system administrators impose a size limit, or
<I>quota</I>, on each volume. You cannot store more data in a
volume than its quota allows. If a volume is close to its quota, you
sometimes cannot save changes you have made to files stored in the
volume.
<P>The amount of space available on the partition that houses the volume also
limits how large the volume can grow. If the disk partition is full,
you can become unable to save changes to a file even though the volume is not
close to its quota.
<A NAME="IDX884"></A>
<A NAME="IDX885"></A>
<P>Check the quota on your home volume periodically to make sure you have
adequate space. Also, if you encounter problems saving a file, check
the quota of the volume in which the file is stored. Use the following
commands to display volume quota.
<UL>
<P><LI>The <B>fs quota</B> command lists the percentage of the volume quota
used.
<P><LI>Both the <B>fs listquota</B> and <B>fs examine</B> commands list
the volume name, its maximum size (quota), and its current size. They
also report the following additional information.
<UL>
<P><LI>The <B>fs listquota</B> command lists the percentage used of both the
volume and the partition.
<P><LI>The <B>fs examine</B> command lists the partition's size, the
amount of space currently used, and any messages associated with the
volume.

<P>Normally, you do not need to know which file server machine stores the
volume containing a file or directory. Given the pathname to a file,
the Cache Manager on your client machine automatically accesses the
appropriate server machine.
<P>If you become unable to access a file, however, it can be useful to know
which file server machine houses it. You can then check whether the
File Server process or machine is functioning correctly, as described in <A HREF="#HDRWQ41">Checking the Status of Server Machines</A>. Or, if your system administrators schedule downtime
for a machine, you can learn whether the outage is likely to prevent you from
accessing certain files.

</PRE>
<P>where <VAR>dir/file path</VAR> specifies the pathname of each file or
directory for which you want location information. If you do not
provide a pathname, the output reports the machine housing the volume that
contains the current working directory.
<P>If the output mentions more than one machine, there is a copy of the volume
at each site (the volume is <I>replicated</I>). Your system
administrators can choose to replicate volumes that contain information many
people need to use, both for load balancing reasons and to make the
information available even if there is an outage on one machine that houses
the volume.

<A NAME="IDX912"></A>
<A NAME="IDX913"></A>
<A NAME="IDX914"></A>
<P>Sometimes one or more server machines in your cell become inaccessible due
to hardware problems, software problems, or routine maintenance. During
the outage, you cannot access files stored on those machines or save any
changes you have made to files that are stored on those machines. (Your
Cache Manager possibly has copies of the files stored locally, which you can
still work with.)
<P>To check the status of server machines, use the <B>fs checkservers</B>
command. If a server machine has more than one network interface
address (is <I>multihomed</I>), the Cache Manager sends the
status-checking message to all of the machine's interfaces. If at
least one of the server's interfaces replies, the command's output
reports the machine as accessible. If there is no reply from any of the
interfaces, the output reports the machine as inaccessible but displays only
one of the interfaces (usually the one with the best preference rank; see
<A HREF="#HDRWQ43">Displaying Server Preference Ranks</A>).
<P>To check the status of different groups of server machines, combine the
<B>fs checkservers</B> command's options as indicated:
<UL>
<P><LI>To check file server machines in the local cell only, do not include any
options
<P><LI>To check file server machines in a particular foreign cell only, include
the <B>-cell</B> argument
<P><LI>To check every file server machine that your Cache Manager has contacted
in any cell, include the <B>-all</B> flag
</UL>
<P>It can take several minutes for the command shell prompt to return, because
the <B>fs</B> command interpreter waits a timeout period before concluding
that an unresponsive machine is really inaccessible. To have the
command shell prompt return immediately, add the ampersand (<B>&amp;</B>),
which runs the <B>fs checkservers</B> command in the background.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_73" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_73">To Check File Server Machine Status</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX915"></A>
<A NAME="IDX916"></A>
<P>Issue the <B>fs checkservers</B> command to check the status of file
server machines.
<PRE>   % <B>fs checkservers</B> [<B>-cell</B> &lt;<VAR>cell&nbsp;to&nbsp;check</VAR>>] [<B>-all</B>]  [<B>&amp;</B>]
</PRE>
<P>where

<P><DT><B>-all
</B><DD>Checks the status of all server machines. Do not combine this flag
and the <B>-cell</B> argument.
</DL>
<P>The following message indicates that all server machines replied to the
Cache Manager's status-checking message:
<PRE>   All servers are running.
</PRE>
<P>Otherwise, a message like the following lists the inaccessible
machines:
<PRE>   These servers unavailable due to network or server problems: <VAR>list&nbsp;of&nbsp;machines</VAR>.

Cache Manager has contacted in any cell. Two machines are not
responding.

<A NAME="IDX918"></A>
<P>The Cache Manager maintains a list of foreign cells that it knows how to
reach. A cell must appear in the list for you to access its AFS
filespace. (In addition, the ACL on each directory in the pathname to
the file must grant you the necessary permissions, and your system
administrator must mount the cell in the local AFS filespace--by
convention, just under the <B>/afs</B> directory.)

<P>Issue the <B>fs listcells</B> command to display the cells you can
access from this client machine. It can take several minutes for the
command shell prompt to return. The Cache Manager stores the machines
as IP addresses, but has the addresses translated to names before displaying
them. To have the command shell prompt return immediately, use the
ampersand (<B>&amp;</B>) to run the <B>fs listcells</B> command in the
background as in the following example.
<PRE>   % <B>fs listcells &amp;</B>
   Cell abc.com  on hosts 
        db1.abc.com

<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ43" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_77">Displaying Server Preference Ranks</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX921"></A>
<A NAME="IDX922"></A>
<A NAME="IDX923"></A>
<P>The Cache Manager stores a list of preference ranks for file server
machines. When it needs to access a file or directory, the Cache
Manager compares the ranks of the file server machines that house the relevant
volume. It first tries to access the volume on the machine with the
best rank. (If a file server machine is multihomed--has more than
one network interface--the Cache Manager actually assigns a separate rank
to each interface.)
<P>The Cache Manager assigns a default rank to a file server machine interface
by comparing its own IP address to the interface's IP address. It
assigns a better rank to interfaces that are on its own subnetwork or network
than to interfaces on other networks. Therefore, the ranks bias the
Cache Manager to fetch files from file server machines that are close in terms
of network distance, which tends to reduce network traffic and help the Cache
Manager deliver data to applications more quickly.
<P>The Cache Manager stores each rank as a pairing of a file server machine
interface's IP address and an integer rank from the range <B>0</B> to
<B>65,534</B>. A lower number is a better rank. To display
the server preference ranks on the local client machine, use the <B>fs
getserverprefs</B> command.
<P>The Cache Manager stores a separate but similar set of ranks for Volume
Location (VL) Servers, which tell the Cache Manager the location of volumes
that house files and directories. To display those ranks, add the
<B>-vlservers</B> flag to the <B>fs getserverprefs</B> command.
<P>If the default ranks do not seem to result in the best performance, your
system administrator can change them. Ask your system administrator
about the ranks if appropriate.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_78" HREF="auusg002.htm#ToC_78">To Display Server Preference Ranks</A></H3>
<P>Issue the <B>fs getserverprefs</B> command to display the file
server machine preference ranks used by the Cache Manager on the local
machine. To display VL Server ranks, add the <B>-vlservers</B>
flag. By default, the Cache Manager has the IP address of each
interface translated into a hostname before displaying it. To bypass
the translation and display IP addresses, include the <B>-numeric</B>
flag. This can significantly speed up the command's output.
<PRE>   % <B>fs getserverprefs</B> [<B>-numeric</B>] [<B>-vlservers</B>]
</PRE>
<P>The following example displays the file server machine preference ranks for
a client machine in the <B>abc.com</B> cell. The ranks of
the file server machines in that cell are lower than the ranks of the file
server machines from the foreign cell, <B>def.com</B>.
Because the <B>-numeric</B> flag is not used, the output displays
hostnames. The appearance of an IP address for two machines indicates
that translating them was not possible.
<PRE>   % <B>fs getserverprefs</B>
