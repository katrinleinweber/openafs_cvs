<HR><H1><A NAME="HDRWQ6" HREF="auqbg002.htm#ToC_7">Installation Overview</A></H1>
<P>This chapter describes the type of instructions provided in
this guide and the hardware and software requirements for installing
AFS<SUP><SUP>(R)</SUP></SUP>.
<P>Before beginning the installation of your cell's first machine, read
this chapter and the material from the <I>IBM AFS Administration Guide</I>
listed in <A HREF="#HDRWQ8">Recommended Reading List</A>. It is also best to read through <A HREF="auqbg005.htm#HDRWQ17">Installing the First AFS Machine</A> before beginning the installation, so that
you understand the overall scope of the installation procedure.
Similarly, before installing additional server or client machines it is best
to read through <A HREF="auqbg006.htm#HDRWQ99">Installing Additional Server Machines</A> and <A HREF="auqbg007.htm#HDRWQ133">Installing Additional Client Machines</A>.
<P>If you are already running a version of AFS, consult the upgrade
instructions in the <I>IBM AFS Release Notes</I> or contact the AFS
Product Support group before proceeding with the installation.
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ7" HREF="auqbg002.htm#ToC_8">The Procedures Described in this Guide</A></H2>
<P>This guide describes two types of installation
procedures: initial procedures (such as installing the first AFS machine
or incorporating AFS into the kernel) and as-needed procedures (such as
installing additional server machines or client machines).
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_9" HREF="auqbg002.htm#ToC_9">Required Initial Procedures</A></H3>
<P>You must perform the following basic procedures to start using
AFS.
<P><H4><A NAME="Header_10">Incorporating AFS Into the Kernel</A></H4>
<P>You must incorporate AFS modifications into the kernel of every AFS
file server and client machine. Depending on the operating system, you
either use a program for dynamic kernel loading, build a new static kernel, or
can choose between the two. For your convenience, the instructions for
incorporating AFS into the kernel appear in full in every chapter where you
need to use them.
<A NAME="IDX2197"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2198"></A>
<P><H4><A NAME="Header_11">Installing the First AFS Machine</A></H4>
<P>You install the first AFS machine in your cell to function as both an
AFS server and client machine. You can disable the client functionality
after completing the installation, if you wish.
<P>The first server machine in a cell performs several functions:
<UL>
<P><LI>It acts as the <I>system control machine</I> (if your AFS distribution
includes the required encryption files), distributing certain configuration
files to the other server machines in the cell
<P><LI>It acts as the <I>binary distribution machine</I> for its system type,
distributing AFS binaries to other server machines of its system type
<P><LI>It acts as the first <I>database server machine</I>, running the
server processes that maintain the AFS administrative databases
</UL>
<P>After you install server and client functionality, you complete other
procedures specific to the first machine, including setting up the top levels
of your cell's AFS filespace.

<P><H4><A NAME="Header_13">Upgrading the Operating System</A></H4>
<P>Upgrading the operating system requires you to take several steps to
protect data and AFS-modified binaries from being lost or overwritten.
For guidelines, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ14">About Upgrading the Operating System</A>.

<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ8" HREF="auqbg002.htm#ToC_18">Recommended Reading List</A></H2>
<P>To develop the best understanding of the overall scope of an
installation procedure, read through the entire chapter or section that
describes it before performing any actions.
<P>In addition, familiarity with some basic AFS concepts can make the
installation more efficient, because you understand better the purpose of the
steps. The following is a prioritized list of material to read before
installing the first AFS machine. At minimum, read the first chapter of
the <I>IBM AFS Administration Guide</I>. Then continue your reading
in the indicated order, as extensively as you can. It is more important
at this point to read the conceptual material in each section than the
instructions.

<P>You must comply with the following requirements to install AFS
successfully.
<A NAME="IDX2201"></A>
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_20" HREF="auqbg002.htm#ToC_20">Login Identity</A></H3>
<P>Log into the machine you are installing as the local superuser
<B>root</B>. When instructed, also authenticate with AFS as the
administrative user <B>admin</B>.
<A NAME="IDX2202"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2203"></A>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ10" HREF="auqbg002.htm#ToC_21">General Requirements</A></H3>
<UL>
<P><LI>You must have the AFS Binary Distribution for each system type you are
installing. Unless otherwise noted, the Binary Distribution includes
software for both client and server machines. If you are using the
CD-ROM version of the distribution, the machine you are installing must be
able to access the CD-ROMs, either through a local CD drive or via an
NFS<SUP><SUP>(R)</SUP></SUP> mount of a CD drive attached to a machine that is
accessible by network.
<P><LI>All AFS machines that belong to a cell must be able to access each other
via the network.
<P><LI>The machine must be running the standard, vendor-supplied version of the
operating system supported by the current version of AFS. The operating
system must already be installed on the machine's root partition.
<P><LI>You must be familiar with the current operating system and disk
configuration of the machine you are installing.
<P><LI>All hardware and non-AFS software on the machine must be functioning
normally.
<P><LI>No critical processes can be running on the machine you are installing,
because you must reboot it during the installation.
</UL>

<A NAME="IDX2205"></A>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ11" HREF="auqbg002.htm#ToC_22">File Server Machine Requirements</A></H3>
<UL>
<P><LI>Cell configuration is simplest if the first machine you install has the
lowest IP address of any database server machine you currently plan to
install. If you later configure a machine with a lower IP address as a
database server machine, you must update the
<B>/usr/vice/etc/CellServDB</B> file on all of your cell's client
machines before the installation. For further discussion, see <A HREF="auqbg006.htm#HDRWQ114">Installing Database Server Functionality</A>.
<P><LI>The partition mounted on the <B>/usr</B> directory must have at least
18 MB of disk space available for storing the AFS server binaries (stored by
convention in the <B>/usr/afs/bin</B> directory). If the machine is
also a client, there must be additional local disk space available, as
specified in <A HREF="#HDRWQ12">Client Machine Requirements</A>. The complete set of AFS binaries requires yet more
space, but they are normally stored in an AFS volume rather than on a
machine's local disk. 
<P>More significant amounts of space on the partition are required by the
administrative databases stored in the <B>/usr/afs/db</B> directory and
the server process log files stored in the <B>/usr/afs/logs</B>
directory. The exact requirement depends on many factors, such as the
size of your cell and how often you truncate the log files.
<P><LI>There must be at least one partition (or logical volume, if the operating
system and AFS support them) dedicated exclusively to storing AFS
volumes. The total number and size of server partitions on all file
server machines in the cell determines how much space is available for AFS
files.
</UL>
<A NAME="IDX2206"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2207"></A>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ12" HREF="auqbg002.htm#ToC_23">Client Machine Requirements</A></H3>
<UL>
<P><LI>The partition mounted on the <B>/usr</B> directory must have at least
4 MB of disk space available for storing the AFS client binaries and kernel
library files (stored by convention in the <B>/usr/vice/etc</B>
directory). The complete set of AFS binaries requires more space, but
they are normally stored in an AFS volume rather than on a machine's
local disk. For most system types, the instructions have you copy only
the one kernel library file appropriate for the machine you are
installing. If you choose to store all of the library files on the
local disk, the space requirement can be significantly greater.
<P><LI>On a client machine that uses a disk cache, there must be enough free
space on the cache partition (by convention, mounted on the
<B>/usr/vice/cache</B> directory) to accommodate the cache. The
minimum recommended cache size is 10 MB, but larger caches generally perform
better.
<P><LI>On a client machine that uses a memory cache, there must be at least 5 MB
of machine memory to devote to caching, but again more memory generally leads
to better performance. For further discussion, see the sections in <A HREF="auqbg007.htm#HDRWQ133">Installing Additional Client Machines</A> about configuring the cache.

<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ13" HREF="auqbg002.htm#ToC_24">Supported System Types</A></H2>
<P>The <I>IBM AFS Release Notes</I> for each AFS release
list the supported system types. Support for subsequent revisions of an
operating system often becomes available between AFS releases. The AFS
Product Support group can provide details.
<P>It is the goal of the AFS Development and Product Support groups to support
AFS on a wide range of popular system types. Furthermore, each time an
operating system vendor releases a new general availability version of a
supported operating system, it is a goal to certify and support AFS on it
within a short time. Support can be delayed a bit longer if it is
necessary to generate completely new binaries.
<P>It is not always possible to support AFS on every intermediate version of
an operating system or for certain processor types. In some cases,
platform limitations make certain AFS functionality (such as file server or
NFS/AFS translator functionality) unavailable on one or more platforms.
For a list of limitations, see the <I>IBM AFS Release Notes</I> or ask the
AFS Product Support group.

<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ14" HREF="auqbg002.htm#ToC_25">About Upgrading the Operating System</A></H2>
<P>Whenever you upgrade an AFS machine to a different operating
system, you must take several actions to maintain proper AFS
functionality. These actions include, but are not necessarily limited
to, the following.
<UL>
<P><LI>Unmount the AFS server partitions (mounted at <B>/vicep</B><VAR>xx</VAR>
directories) on all file server machines, to prevent the vendor-supplied
<B>fsck</B> program from running on them when you reboot the machine
during installation of the new operating system. Before upgrading the
operating system, it is prudent to comment out commands in the machine's
initialization file that remount the server partitions, to prevent them from
being remounted until you can replace the standard <B>fsck</B> program
with the AFS-modified version. The instructions in this guide for
installing AFS server machines explain how to replace the <B>fsck</B>
program.
<P><LI>Protect the AFS-modified versions of commands and configuration files from
being overwritten by vendor-supplied versions. These include
<B>vfsck</B> (the AFS version of <B>fsck</B>), binaries for the UNIX
remote services such as <B>inetd</B>, and configuration files such as the
one for the Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM). After you have
successfully installed the operating system, remember to move the AFS-modified
commands and files back to the locations where they are accessed during normal
functioning.
<P><LI>Reformat the server partitions to accommodate AFS-specific information, in
certain cases. The upgrade instructions that accompany the new AFS
binaries for an affected platform always detail the required procedure.

<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ15" HREF="auqbg002.htm#ToC_26">The AFS Binary Distribution</A></H2>
<P>The AFS Binary Distribution includes a separate CD-ROM for
each supported system type, containing all AFS binaries and files for both
server and client machines. The instructions in this guide specify when
to mount the CD-ROM and which files or directories to copy to the local disk
or into an AFS volume.
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ16" HREF="auqbg002.htm#ToC_27">How to Continue</A></H2>
<P>If you are installing the first AFS machine in your cell,
proceed to <A HREF="auqbg005.htm#HDRWQ17">Installing the First AFS Machine</A>.
<P>If you are installing an additional file server machine, or configuring or
decommissioning a database server machine, proceed to <A HREF="auqbg006.htm#HDRWQ99">Installing Additional Server Machines</A>.
