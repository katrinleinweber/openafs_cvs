/* Locks hang off of each transaction, with all the transaction hanging off of
 * the appropriate dbase.  This package expects to be used in a two-phase locking
 * protocol, so it doesn't provide a way to release anything but all of the locks in the
 * transaction.
 *
 * At present, it doesn't support the setting of more than one byte-position lock at a time, that is
 * the length field must be 1.  This doesn't mean that a single transaction can't set more than
 * one lock, however.
 *
 * It is the responsibility of the user to avoid deadlock by setting locks in a partial order.
 *
 * EWOULDBLOCK has been replaced in this file by EAGAIN. Many Unix's but not
 * all (eg. HP) do not replace EWOULDBLOCK with EAGAIN. The bad news is this
 * goes over the wire. The good news is that the code path is never triggered
 * as it requires ulock_getLock to be called with await = 0. And ulock_SetLock
 * isn't even used in this code base. Since NT doesn't have a native
 * EAGAIN, we are replacing all instances of EWOULDBLOCK with EAGAIN.
