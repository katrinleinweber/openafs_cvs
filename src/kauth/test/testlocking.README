The testlocking scripts are really EXPECT scripts, not merely TCL.
They are used by running "expect testlocking.general.tcl" and "expect
testlocking.boundaries.tcl".  I don't recommend running them simultaneously,
as they modify the same user records.  That would not be too difficult to
change if necessary.

The output from the scripts is a trace of the entire test, punctuated by lines
of the form:
SUCCESS  blah blah blah
or 
FAILED:  blah blah blah

The easiest way to use these at present is to do something like:
% expect testlocking.general.tcl | tee locklog.general | grep '^FAIL'
This way, if you don't get any output, you know the test completed successfully,
but if you do get output, you can still look at the traces.

There are some aspects of this new feature that are not explicitly checked by
the test scripts, but can be verified by examining the logs.  Also, the test
scripts don't sleep for any period of time to determine whether an id will 
automatically unlock properly or not.
