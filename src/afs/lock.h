/* The following macros allow multi statement macros to be defined safely, i.e.
   - the multi statement macro can be the object of an if statement;
   - the call to the multi statement macro may be legally followed by a semi-colon.
   BEGINMAC and ENDMAC have been tested with both the portable C compiler and
   Hi-C.  Both compilers were from the Palo Alto 4.2BSD software releases, and
   both optimized out the constant loop code.  For an example of the use
   of BEGINMAC and ENDMAC, see the definition for ReleaseWriteLock, below.
   An alternative to this, using "if(1)" for BEGINMAC is not used because it
   may generate worse code with pcc, and may generate warning messages with hi-C.

/*

You can also use the lock package for handling parent locks for independently-lockable sets of
small objects.  The concept here is that the parent lock is at the same level in the
locking hierarchy as the little locks, but certain restrictions apply.

The general usage pattern is as follows.  You have a set of entries to search.  When searching it, you
have a "scan" lock on the table.  If you find what you're looking for, you drop the lock down
to a "hold" lock, lock the entry, and release the parent lock.  If you don't find what
you're looking for, you create the entry, downgrade the "scan" lock to a "hold" lock,
lock the entry and unlock the parent.

To delete an item from the table, you initially obtain a "purge" lock on the parent.  Unlike all
of the other parent lock modes described herein, in order to obtain a "purge" lock mode, you
must have released all locks on any items in the table.  Once you have obtained the parent
lock in "purge" mode, you should check to see if the entry is locked.  If its not locked, you
are free to delete the entry, knowing that no one else can attempt to obtain a lock
on the entry while you have the purge lock held on the parent.  Unfortunately, if it *is* locked,
you can not lock it yourself and wait for the other dude to release it, since the entry's locker
may need to lock another entry before unlocking the entry you want (which would result in
deadlock).  Instead, then, you must release the parent lock, and try again "later" (see Lock_Wait
for assistance in waiting until later). Unfortunately, this is the best locking paradigm I've yet
come up with.

What are the advantages to this scheme?  First, the use of the parent lock ensures that
two people don't try to add the same entry at the same time or delete an entry while someone
else is adding it.  It also ensures that when one process is deleting an entry, no one else is
preparing to lock the entry.  Furthermore, when obtaining a lock on a little entry, you
are only holding a "hold" lock on the parent lock, so that others may come in and search
the table during this time.  Thus it will not hold up the system if a little entry takes
a great deal of time to free up.

Here's how to compute the compatibility matrix:

The invariants are:

add	no deletions, additions allowed, additions will be performed, will obtain little locks
hold	no deletions, additions allowed, no additions will be performed, will obtain little locks
purge	no deletions or additions allowed, deletions will be performed, don't obtain little locks

When we compute the locking matrix, we note that hold is compatible with hold and add.
Add is compatible only with hold.  purge is not compatible with anything.  This is the same
matrix as obtained by mapping add->S, hold->read and purge->write locks.  Thus we
can use the locks above to solve this problem, and we do.
