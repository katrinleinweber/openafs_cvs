In this file you'll find notes to help you build OpenAFS on various platforms.

Redhat 7.0 (i386_linux22): 
	src/venus/kdump.c may fail to compile with the gcc included with 
	RedHat 7.0; You'll need to use kgcc to compile it.  You should 
	be able to use kgcc to compile all of AFS. Just add CC=kgcc 
	to your make arguments.

	When building for kernels other than the stock kernel you
	may need to create symlinks in /usr/src named for your 
	configuration, e.g. linux-2.2.16-22smp pointing to your
	source tree (linux-2.2.16-22); Redhat provides a unified 
	source tree with a switch in include/linux/version.h.

HPUX 11.0 (hp_ux110):
	Does not currently build libafs, which means no afs client support,
	however, the client tools, and all of the server code does get built.
	
	For future kernel development, the KernDevKit package from the CoreOS
	media is required.
