NAME

   vos status -- report activity of Volume Server.


   vos status  -server <machine name>  [-cell <cell name>]
   [-noauth]
   [-localauth]  [-verbose]  [-help]

ACCEPTABLE ABBREVIATIONS/ALIASES

   vos st  -s <machine name>  [-c <cell name>]  [-n]  [-l]
   [-v]  [-h]

DESCRIPTION

   Reports  on  what the Volume Server on a certain file server
   machine is doing at the moment the command is  issued.    If
   there is no activity, it returns nothing.

   Useful  mainly if there is concern that the Volume Server is
   not performing requested actions.

ARGUMENTS

   -server         names a file server  machine.    Abbreviated
                   forms   of  machine  names  may  be  allowed
                   depending on the naming service available at
                   the time the command is issued; see page xii
                   in  the  introductory  About   This   Manual
                   chapter.  -cell
                   specifies the  cell  in  which  to  run  the
                   command.    See section 8.3 in the Reference
                   Manual for more details.  -noauth
                   tells the Volume and Volume Location Servers
                   to assign  the  identity  anonymous  to  the
                   issuer.    See  section 8.3 in the Reference
                   Manual for more details.  -localauth
                   constructs  a server ticket using a key from
                   /usr/afs/etc/KeyFile.  See  section  8.3  in
                   the   Reference  Manual  for  more  details.
                   -verbose
                   tells the Volume and Volume Location Servers
                   to report on what they  are  doing  as  they
                   execute the command.  See section 8.3 in the
                   Reference Manual for more details.  -help
                   prints the online help for this command.  Do
                   not provide any  other  arguments  or  flags
                   with  this  one.    See  section  8.3 in the
                   Reference Manual for more details.



OUTPUT

   There are two possible types of output.

   The following message indicates that the  Volume  Server  is
   not currently performing any actions.

       No active transactions on machine name

   The  other  possible output is a set of information which is
   probably  more  useful  to  programmers   than   to   system
   administrators.    A  full  understanding  of all the fields
   requires familiarity with the code for the Volume Server, as
   many  of  the  fields report ID numbers and flag values that
   the Volume Server sets for internal use.

   Among the fields of possible interest  to  an  administrator
   are:

      - created  on  the  first  line, which indicates the
        time at which this transaction started

      - attachFlags on the second line, where a  value  of
        offline indicates that the volume is not available
        for other read or  write  operations  during  this
        transaction

      - volume  on  the  third  line,  which specifies the
        affected volume's ID number

      - partition on the third line, which indicates where
        the  affected  volume resides (at the beginning of
        the transaction if this is a move)

      - procedure on the third line, which  indicates  the
        internal subprocedure being executed

   A  fourth  line  may appear during certain transactions, and
   includes the following fields:

      - packetRead tracks  whether  information  is  being
        read  into  the volume.  Its absolute value is not
        informative, but the way it changes shows  whether
        the vos restore command is executing properly.  As
        vos status is issued repeatedly during a  restore,
        readNext should increase monotonically to indicate
        that information is being read into the volume.

      - packetSend tracks  whether  information  is  being
        sent out of the volume.  Its absolute value is not
        informative, but the way it changes shows  whether
        the  vos dump  command  is executing properly.  As
        vos status is issued  repeatedly  during  a  dump,
        transmitNext   should  increase  monotonically  to
        indicate that  information  is  being  transferred
        from the volume into the dump file.

   The lastReceiveTime and lastSendTime are for internal use.



EXAMPLE

   The  following  illustrates the kind of output that might be
   seen if the Volume Server on fs1.transarc.com is executing a
   dump when this command is issued.

       % vos status fs1.transarc.com
       --------------------------------------------
       transaction: 575  created: Tue Jan 2 8:34:56 1990
       attachFlags: offline
       volume: 536871080 partition: /vicepb procedure: Dump
       packetRead: 2 lastReceiveTime: 113313 packetSend: 24
           lastSendTime: 113317
       --------------------------------------------

PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

   None.
