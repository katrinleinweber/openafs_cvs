fs sysname                 AFS Commands              fs sysname


NAME

   fs sysname -- report or set CPU/operating system type.


   fs sysname [-newsys <new sysname>]  [-help]

ACCEPTABLE ABBREVIATIONS/ALIASES

   fs sy [-n <new sysname>]  [-h]

DESCRIPTION

   Depending   on  whether  the  issuer  provides  the  -newsys
   argument,

   EITHER sets the indicator of CPU/operating system type in th
   the machine on which the command is issued

   OR reports the current setting.

   If the command is issued on an AFS client machine, the value
   is set/reported for the machine itself.

   If  the command is issued on an NFS client machine accessing
   AFS via the NFS/AFS Translator, then  the  specified  CPU/OS
   value  is  set/reported  for  the  NFS  client machine.  The
   information is in a record  maintained  by  the  AFS  client
   machine  serving  as  the  NFS  client's  NFS/AFS translator
   machine.  The translator machine maintains a separate record
   for each user logged into the NFS client.  This implies that
   if a user adopts a new identity (UNIX UID)  during  a  login
   session  on  the  NFS clientMperhaps using suMhe or she must
   issue this command again.  Setting this indicator allows the
   translator machine to provide the NFS client with the proper
   version of program binaries when the  user  issues  commands
   for which the binaries are kept in the AFS file tree.

   The Cache Manager's main use of this indicator is as a value
   for the "@sys" variable which can occur  in  AFS  pathnames.
   As  the  Cache  Manager interprets pathnames, it substitutes
   the indicator's value for any occurrence of @sys.   See  the
   EXAMPLES  section for an example.  (Note that @sys should be
   used sparingly, as  it  can  make  the  effect  of  changing
   directories    unpredictable;    see    the    AFS    System
   Administrator's Guide for further information.)

ARGUMENTS

   -newsys   specifies the new  setting  of  the  CPU/operating
             system  indicator  for  the machine on which it is
             issued.  If the issuer omits it, the output  shows
             the  current  setting.    Consult  the  AFS System
             Administrator's Guide for a complete list  of  the
             legal values and the CPU/OS types they represent.

   -help     prints the online help entry for this command.  Do
             not provide any other arguments or flags with this
             one.   See section 3.1 in the Reference Manual for
             more details.



OUTPUT

   The output reports the machine's system type in the format

       Current sysname is 'system type'

EXAMPLES

   The  following  shows  the  output   produced   on   a   Sun
   SPARCStation running SunOS 4.1:

   % fs sy  Current sysname is 'sun4c_41'

   The  following  defines a machine to be a DECStation running
   Ultrix 4.1:

   % fs sysname pmax_ul4

   When the Cache Manager on the machine encounters a  pathname
   with  the  @sys  variable in it, it substitutes pmax_ul4 for
   the variable.  For instance, this  machine  would  interpret
   the pathname

      /afs/transarc.com/@sys/usr/bin
   as
      /afs/transarc.com/pmax_ul4/usr/bin
   and would access the volume corresponding to that directory.
   A machine whose CPU/OS type was rt_aos4 would interpret  the
   same pathname as

      /afs/transarc.com/rt_aos4/usr/bin

   and so would access a volume different from that accessed by
   the DECStation.

PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

   None, if the machine is an NFS client.  If the machine is an
   AFS  client,  the  issuer must be logged into the local UNIX
   file system as "root."
