                       associated VLDB entry.

DESCRIPTION

   Creates a ReadWrite volume, names it volume name and  places
   it at the site specified by machine name and partition name.
   The  volume  automatically  receives  a   volumeID   number,
   recorded  in  both the VLDB and the volume header.  The VLDB
   status flag for the ReadWrite site is set to valid.

   If this command succeeds, then the volume is  available  for
   use, though it must be mounted in the file system before its
   contents are accessible.  Use  the  fs  mkmount  command  to
   mount a volume.

   This  command  creates  a  default  ACL  associated with the
   volume's "root directory" (which  takes  the  same  name  as
   volume's  mount  point  when  the  volume  is  mounted  with
   fs mkmount).  The ACL grants  all  seven  access  rights  to
   system:administrators.    The volume's space quota is set to
   5000 kilobyte blocks by default.

   The Volume Location Server also pre-allocates,  and  records
   in  the  VLDB,  volumeID numbers for the ReadOnly and Backup
   versions that may be created later.  It  does  not  actually
   create  those  types  of  volumes  or  place  anything  at a
   ReadOnly or Backup site, so the status  flags  for  ReadOnly
   and Backup are set to invalid.

WARNING

   No more that 3500 volumes should reside on one partition.  A
   greater  number  can  cause  the  AFS  Salvager  process  to
   malfunction.    It  is  the issuer's responsibility to check
   that issuing this command will not cause  the  limit  to  be
   exceeded.    The  vos listvol  command reports the number of
   volumes on a partition.



ARGUMENTS

   -server         names the file server machine  on  which  to
                   create    the    new    ReadWrite    volume.
                   Abbreviated forms of machine  names  may  be
                   allowed  depending  on  the  naming  service
                   available at the time the command is issued;
                   see  page xii in the introductory About This
                   Manual chapter.  -partition
                   names  the  particular  partition  where the
                   ReadWrite volume is to reside.  In  addition
                   to  the  full  /vicepx  form  of a partition
                   name, three shorter  forms  are  acceptable;
                   see  page xii in the introductory About This
                   Manual chapter.  -name
                   specifies  a  name for the ReadWrite volume,
                   preferably descriptive of its contents.   It
                   may be no longer than 22 characters, but may
                   contain  upper-   and   lowercase   letters,
                   numbers  and  punctuation.    By convention,
                   periods separate the fields in a name.    Do
                   not  use  the extension .backup or .readonly
                   on ReadWrite volume names; the Volume Server
                   automatically  adds  these  extensions  when
                   creating those volume types.

   -cell           specifies the  cell  in  which  to  run  the
                   command.    See section 8.3 in the Reference
                   Manual for more details.  -noauth
                   tells the Volume and Volume Location Servers
                   to assign  the  identity  anonymous  to  the
                   issuer.    See  section 8.3 in the Reference
                   Manual for more details.  -localauth
                   constructs  a server ticket using a key from
                   /usr/afs/etc/KeyFile.  See  section  8.3  in
                   the   Reference  Manual  for  more  details.
                   -verbose
                   tells the Volume and Volume Location Servers
                   to report on what they  are  doing  as  they
                   execute the command.  See section 8.3 in the
                   Reference Manual for more details.  -help
                   prints the online help for this command.  Do
                   not provide any  other  arguments  or  flags
                   with  this  one.    See  section  8.3 in the
                   Reference Manual for more details.

   /vicepf partition of fs4.transarc.com.

   % vos c fs4.transarc.com /vicepf user.pat

PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

   Issuer must be listed in /usr/afs/etc/UserList on -server.
