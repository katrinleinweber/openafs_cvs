Template "S" line          AFS Commands       Template "S" line


NAME

   Template "S" line -- create symbolic link.


   S <existing-file> <link>

DESCRIPTION

   Creates  a "symbolic link" between two files, as achieved by
   the standard Unix ln -s command.  An explanation of links is
   beyond  the  scope of this document, but the basic effect is
   to create a second name for an existing file, so that it can
   be  accessed  via  either name.  It does not create a second
   copy of the file.

   AFS allows symbolic links to cross mount  points  (that  is,
   the linked files may reside in different volumes).

   "S"  lines  should  appear  in the template after "D" lines;
   they should also appear after "F" and "E" lines if either of
   the  files  being  linked  were created on such a line.  Any
   number of "S" lines may appear in a template.

ARGUMENTS

   S               should be a capital  letter  and  tells  the
                   command  interpreter  that  this instruction
                   creates a symbolic link.

   existing-file   is the complete  pathname  of  the  existing
                   file.

   link            is  the complete pathname of the second name
                   for the file.

EXAMPLE

   The following,  appropriate  for  the  Transarc  Corporation
   cell,  links  the  file outgoing in the Mail subdirectory to
   the file /afs/transarc.com/common/mail/outgoing.

      S /afs/transarc.com/common/mail/outgoing $MTPT/Mail/o
