rlogind (AFS version)      AFS Commands   rlogind (AFS version)


NAME

   rlogind (AFS version) -- initialize remote login server.


   /etc/rlogind

DESCRIPTION

   Functions  like the standard UNIX rlogind, except that it is
   appropriate only for cells using  the  AFS  version  of  the
   login program supplied by Transarc Corporation.

   The  AFS  modifications to rlogind are strictly internal and
   are necessary so that remote AFS authentication is  possible
   with the rlogin command.  When a user issues rlogin, the AFS
   version of rlogind running on the remote machine invokes the
   AFS  version of login; the user therefore obtains AFS tokens
   on the remote machine.

   In the configuration recommended  by  Transarc  Corporation,
   the  AFS  version of rlogind is substituted for the standard
   versionMbut only if the AFS version of login is  also  being
   used  in the cell. (Only one version of rlogind can run on a
   machine at a time.)  The administrator then has two choices:

      - name the binary for the AFS version something like
        rlogind.afs,   leaving  the  standard  version  as
        rlogind.  Refer to rlogind.afs  in  inetd.conf.afs
        (the  AFS  version of inetd.conf), and comment out
        the reference  to  standard  rlogind  in  standard
        inetd.conf.

      - name  the  binary  for the AFS version rlogind and
        rename the binary  for  the  standard  version  to
        something  like  rlogind.old.  Refer to rlogind in
        inetd.conf.afs (the AFS  version  of  inetd.conf),
        and  comment  out  the  reference  to  rlogind  in
        standard inetd.conf.

WARNINGS

   The AFS version of rlogind is  not  available  for  the  AIX
   2.2.1  operating  system.  (AIX  2.2.1  does not include the
   standard rlogind either.)

   Do not install the AFS version of rlogind if the AFS version
   of login is not being used in the cell.

   Remote AFS authentication is possible with rlogin only if

   EITHER no .rhosts file exists on the machine where rlogind
   is running

   OR .rhosts exists on the machine where rlogind is running, b
   has mode bits more liberal than -rw-r--r--.  If .rhosts has
   mode bits as restrictive as -rw-r--r--, then rlogind logs th
   issuer of the remote rlogin command into the local UNIX file
   system without prompting for a password.  The issuer does no
   tokens (authenticate with AFS), because that requires provid
   password.  The user can, however, obtain tokens by issuing p



   and klog after establishing the connection.

   The  protection  required  on  .rhosts for token creation to
   work properly are exactly opposite those necessary  for  the
   AFS  versions of rcp and rsh to handle tokens properly.  The
   recommended solution is to configure .rhosts so that rcp and
   rsh work properly and to use telnet instead of rlogin.

   No  modifications  to  rlogin  itself  are necessary for AFS
   authentication to work.
