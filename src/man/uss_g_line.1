Template "G" line          AFS Commands       Template "G" line


NAME

   Template "G" line -- define directory for even distribution

                       of home directories.


   G  <directory>

DESCRIPTION

   Defines a directory to be considered  as  a  value  for  the
   $AUTO  variable.    Define  a  separate  "G"  line  for each
   directory to be considered.  All "G" lines, and there may be
   any   number,   must  appear  in  the  template  before  any
   occurrences of the $AUTO variable.

   The intended use of the  "G"  line  is  to  distribute  user
   accounts  randomly  among  several  directories, rather than
   using divisions that reflect real-world divisions  (such  as
   departmental affiliation).

   Creating multiple "usr" directories in this fashion (perhaps
   numbered as usr1, usr2 and so on) is useful mostly in a very
   large  cell  where having all user home directories together
   in one usr directory could cause slow lookup.    In  such  a
   case,  the $AUTO variable goes in the <mount point> field in
   the "V" line.  The command  interpreter  then  selects  from
   among  the directories defined on "G" lines the one with the
   fewest entries.  See the chapter on uss in  the  AFS  System
   Administrator's Guide for more information.

ARGUMENTS

   G               should  be  a  capital  letter and tells the
                   command interpreter that this line defines a
                   directory  to  be  considered as a value for
                   the $AUTO variable.

   directory       defines a pathname.   It  may  be  either  a
                   complete  pathname or only the final element
                   (the directory itself).  The choice  affects
                   the  form  of  the  "V"  line  <mount-point>
                   field's value,  as  shown  in  the  EXAMPLES
                   section.

EXAMPLES

   If the Transarc Corporation cell's administrators decided to
   distribute  user  home   directories   evenly   into   three
   directories, they would define three "G" lines:

      G usr1
      G usr2
      G usr3

   and then put

      /afs/transarc.com/$AUTO/$USER

   in the "V" line <mount-point> field.



   Alternatively,  they  could  put the entire pathname for the
   usr directories on the "G" line:

      G /afs/transarc.com/usr1
      G /afs/transarc.com/usr2
      G /afs/transarc.com/usr3

   in which case the "V" line <mount-point> field would specify
   simply

      $AUTO/$USER
