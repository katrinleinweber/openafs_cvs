   fs la  [-p <dir/file path> ]  [-h]

DESCRIPTION

   Displays  the access control list (ACL) associated with each
   directory.  It is legal to provide a filename rather than  a
   directory  name  for directory, in which case the ACL of the
   file's parent directory is  displayed  (because  it  is  not
   possible  to  set an ACL for an individual file, the file is
   inheriting the ACL from its parent directory).    Omit  this
   switch to display the ACL of the current working directory.

   Users  who possess the ADMINISTER right on an ACL may change
   the ACL with the fs setacl command or copy the  ACL  from  a
   different directory to it with the fs copyacl command.

WARNING

   The  appearance  of a user/group on the Negative rights list
   does not guarantee that the person is denied  those  rights.
   If system:anyuser is granted any rights on the Normal rights
   list, a user need only unlog to obtain those rights.

ARGUMENTS

   -path           specifies each  file  and/or  directory  for
                   which  to  display  the  associated ACL.  If
                   this  argument  is   omitted,   the   output
                   displays the ACL associated with the current
                   working directory.  If it is a filename, the
                   ACL  displayed is associated with the file's
                   parent directory.

   -help           prints  the  online  help  entry  for   this
                   command.  Do not provide any other arguments
                   or flags with this one.  See section 3.1  in
                   the Reference Manual for more details.

OUTPUT

   The  first line of the output names the directory associated
   with the access control list.  If the issuer used  shorthand
   notation  (such  as  "."  for  the  current  directory) when
   indicating the directory, it may appear here rather than the
   full pathname of the directory.



   The  "Normal rights:" header indicates the list of users who
   have normal rights to the directory.   Each  following  line
   lists a user/group name and the set of rights the user/group
   may exercise.  The possible rights and their meanings are


      - r = READ the contents of files in the directory

      - w = WRITE (modify) the contents of  files  in  the
        directory

      - l  =  LOOKUP status information about the files in
        the directory

      - d = DELETE files from the directory

      - i = INSERT new files into the directory

      - k = LOCK; set read or write locks on the files  in
        the directory

      - a  =  ADMINISTER;  change the rights on the access
        control list

      - A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H; by default, these have  no
        meaning  to  AFS server processes.  Administrators
        and application programs may  assign  meanings  to
        them  and  place them on ACLs to control access to
        the directory's contents in new ways.  The letters
        must be uppercase.

   A "Negative rights:" header may appear next, if any negative
   rights have been specified for this directory.   The  format
   of  this list is the same as that of the Normal rights list.
   The difference  is  that  the  user(s)/group(s)  listed  are
   denied rather than granted the specified rights.

EXAMPLES

   The  following  displays  the ACL associated with user pat's
   home  directory  and  its  private  subdirectory  when   the
   fs listacl command is issued in the home directory:

   % fs la . private  Access list for . is  Normal rights:
   system:authuser rl     pat rlidwka     pat:friends rlid
   Negative rights:     smith rlidwka

   Access list for private is  Normal rights:     pat rlidwka



PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

   To issue this command with a directory name argument, issuer
   must have the LOOKUP right on the directory's ACL.  To issue
   command  with a filename argument, the issuer must have both
   the LOOKUP and READ rights on the ACL of the  file's  parent
   directory.
