Template "E" line          AFS Commands       Template "E" line


NAME

   Template "E" line -- create a single-line file.


   E <pathname> <mode> <owner> "<contents>"

DESCRIPTION

   Creates  a  file anywhere in the file system by echoing what
   appears in the <contents> field into  the  new  file.    Its
   intended  use  is the creation of files in the new user home
   directory or its subdirectories.

   The "E" line's advantage over the "F" line is that variables
   may appear in the <contents> field.  The command interpreter
   replaces  the  variables  with  appropriate  values   before
   creating  the  file.    (In contrast, the contents of a file
   created using the "F"  line  are  the  same  for  everyone.)
   However, the "E" line restricts the contents of the new file
   to  a  single  line,  since  no  carriage  returns  (newline
   characters) can occur in the <contents> field.

   An "E" line should appear in the template after the "D" line
   that creates the directory the file is to reside  in.    Any
   number of "E" lines may appear in a template.

WARNING

   Using  the  "E"  line to create a file outside AFS (e.g., in
   the UNIX file system of the client  machine  where  the  uss
   command is being issued) introduces a potential complication
   if the issuer wishes to set the <owner> field  to  something
   other  than  his  or  her  own  user  name or UNIX UID.  The
   default owner of a UNIX file system directory  is  the  user
   who  created  it  (in  this  case,  the  issuer  of  the uss
   command).  Changing this default, which uss will attempt  if
   anything other than the issuer's name appears in the <owner>
   field, requires issuing the chown  command,  which  in  turn
   requires  being the super-user "root".  If the issuer wishes
   to specify an alternate owner, he or she must be  "root"  in
   the  UNIX file system and use the -admin flag in order to be
   recognized in AFS as a privileged administrator.    See  the
   description of the -admin argument for uss add and uss bulk.

   The preferred method for automatic placement of files on the
   local disk is the package program, which runs as "root".

ARGUMENTS

   E         should be a capital letter and tells  the  command
             interpreter   that   this   is   a   file-creation
             instruction.

   pathname  is the full pathname of the file to be created.

   mode      sets the UNIX mode bits for the file.   Provide  a
             four-digit  decimal  number in this field, such as
             0666 or 0644.

   owner     names the file's owner (in the  UNIX  file  system



             sense).    If the file is being placed in AFS, the
             $UID variable should appear in this field.  If the
             file  is  being  placed  into the UNIX file system
             rather than AFS, this field must contain the  user
             name  or  UNIX UID of the uss command's issuer, or
             the account creation will abort at that point.

   contents  defines the one-line string that is to become  the
             contents of the new file.  Surround it with double
             quotes in case it contains spaces.  It may contain
             variables,  which  the  command  interpreter  will
             resolve before creating  the  file,  but  may  not
             contain carriage returns (newline characters).

EXAMPLE

   The  following  creates  an  file  in  the  current  working
   directory called user_name.etcp containing an entry suitable
   for incorporating into the cell's global /etc/passwd file.

       E  $USER.etcp  0644 root "$USER:X:$UID:10:$NAME:$MTP
