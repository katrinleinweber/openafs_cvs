                           AFS Commands

   1. The fs Commands

   ------------------------------------------------------------

   This  command  defines the fs commands that users and system
   administrators employ to contact  the  File  Server  and  to
   configure  the  Cache  Manager.    It  assumes the reader is
   familiar with the  concepts  described  in  the  AFS  System
   Administrator's Guide.

   Some  fs  commands  extend  UNIX  file  system  semantics by
   invoking file-related functions that UNIX does  not  provide
   (setting  access  control  lists,  for  example).   Other fs
   commands help users control the  performance  of  the  Cache
   Manager  running  on  their  local client workstation.  When
   using fs commands, pay particular attention to the  kind  of
   privilege required, as it varies from command to command.

   Refer to the Command Summary at the end of this document for
   a complete list of fs commands and their syntax.

   1.1 Common Arguments and Flags
   All fs commands accept the following optional flag.   It  is
   listed  in  the  command  descriptions  and  is described in
   detail here:

   [-help]

   This flag has the same function as the fs help command:   It
   prints  a  command's  online help message on the screen.  No
   other arguments or flags should be provided at the same time
   as  this  flag.   If they are, this flag overrides them, and
   the only effect of issuing the  command  is  that  the  help
   message appears.

   1.2 The Privileges Required for fs Commands
   The privileges required for fs commands vary more than those
   required  for  commands  in  other  suites.    Pay   special
   attention  to the PRIVILEGE REQUIRED section of each command
   description.

   The various types of necessary privilege include


      - Having certain  rights  on  a  directory's  access
        control  list.  For example, creating and removing
        mount  points  requires  ADMINISTER,  INSERT,  and
        DELETE rights for the directory in which the mount
        point  resides.    Setting  a  directory's  access
        control list requires certain rights, too.

      - Being  logged  in  as the super-user "root" in the
        UNIX file system  of  the  machine  on  which  the
        command  is  being issued.  This is necessary when
        issuing  commands  that   affect   Cache   Manager
        configuration.

      - Belonging  to  the  system:administrators group in
        the  Protection  Database.    See  the   fs setvol
        command for an example.

      - No  privilege.    Many  fs  commands  simply  list
        information and so  do  not  require  any  special
        privilege.
