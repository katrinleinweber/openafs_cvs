tokens                     AFS Commands                  tokens


NAME

   tokens -- display all tokens.


   tokens

DESCRIPTION

   Instructs  the Cache Manager on the local machine to display
   all tokens (tickets) it has for  the  issuer.    AFS  server
   processes  require  that  their  clients  present a token as
   evidence that they have authenticated in the server's  local
   cell.

OUTPUT

   The  output  lists one token for each cell in which the user
   is authenticated.  The output indicates:

      - the user's AFS UID, if it is available for display

      - the server for which the token is valid (normally,
        "afs").  This includes a cell specification.

      - the day and time the token expires

   An --End of list-- message appears at the end of the output.
   If the user is not authenticated in any cell,  this  message
   is all that appears.

EXAMPLES

   The  following  shows  the  output  when  the  issuer is not
   authenticated in any cell.


   % tokens
   Tokens held by the Cache Manager:

       [  1]   --End of list--

   The  following  shows  the  output  when   the   issuer   is
   authenticated  in Transarc Corporation cell, where he or she
   has AFS UID 1000.


   % tokens
   Tokens held by the Cache Manager:

       [  1]User's (AFS ID 1000) tokens for afs@transarc.co
                                         [Expires Jan 2 10:
       [  2]    --End of list--

   The  following  shows  the  output  when   the   issuer   is
   authenticated  in  Transarc Corporation cell, Andrew cell at
   Carnegie Mellon University and Athena cell at MIT.  The user
   has  different AFS UIDs in the three cells.  Tokens for last
   cell are expired:



   % tokens
   Tokens held by the Cache Manager:

       [  1]User's (AFS ID 1000) tokens for afs@transarc.co
                          [Expires Jan 3 10:00]
       [  2]User's (AFS ID 4286) tokens for afs@andrew.cmu.
                          [Expires Jan 3 1:34]
       [  3]User's (AFS ID 22) tokens for afs@athena.mit.ed
                          [>>Expired<<]
       [  4]    --End of list--
