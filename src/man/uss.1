                           AFS Commands

   1. The uss Commands and Template Lines

   ------------------------------------------------------------

   The uss commands help administrators create user accounts in
   their system more easily and  efficiently.    Without  them,
   administering  accounts can become time consuming.  Creating
   an account "by hand" requires issuing at least six  separate
   commands  to  five  different  AFS servers, whereas a single
   uss add command can accomplish all  the  equivalent  actions
   once  the  issuer  sets  up  the  necessary  template.  Even
   better, a single issue  of  the  the  uss bulk  command  can
   create  multiple  accounts  at  once,  after  the  necessary
   preparations have been made.

   Refer to chapter 11 in the Reference Manual for  a  complete
   summary list of uss commands and their syntax.

   1.1 Common Arguments and Flags
   Most  uss  commands  accept the following optional arguments
   and flags.  They are  listed  in  the  command  descriptions
   where they apply, and are described here in detail:

   [-cell <cell name>]

   This  argument  specifies  that the command should be run in
   the cell specified by cell name.  By default,  commands  are
   executed    in    the    local    cell,    as   defined   in
   /usr/vice/etc/ThisCell on the client machine  on  which  the
   command  is  issued.  The issuer may abbreviate cell name to
   the shortest form that distinguishes it from the other cells
   listed  in /usr/vice/etc/CellServDB on the client machine on
   which the command is issued.

   [-admin <administrator to authenticate>]

   This argument names the user name  whom  the  Authentication
   Servers  should  authenticate  for  purposes  of creating an
   Authentication Database entry.    If  the  issuer  does  not
   provide   it,   the  authentication  is  attempted  for  the
   effective user name (the  one  under  which  the  issuer  is
   logged  into the local machine's UNIX file system).  With or
   without this argument, UNIX commands invoked by this command
   (for  instance, /etc/chown) are executed under the effective
   user name.

   [-dryrun]

   This flag indicates that the command interpreter should  not
   actually  execute  the  command,  but  should report all the
   actions it would perform if executing  it.    This  flag  is
   useful  for verifying that the account will be configured as
   the issuer wishes.  It does not, however, necessarily reveal
   failures  that  will  result  if the uss command interpreter
   encounters any circumstances  that  make  it  impossible  to
   carry  out  a  requested  action.  Combining  this flag with
   -verbose yields more information.

   [-help]

   This flag has the same function as the bos help command:  it
   prints  the command's online help message on the screen.  No
   other arguments or flags should  be  provided  at  the  same
   time.    Even if they are, this flag overrides them, and the
   only effect of issuing the command is that the help  message
   appears.



   1.1.1 The Privilege Required for uss Commands
   The  issuer  of  a  uss  command  must  have  all the rights
   required for performing the equivalent actions individually.
   See   the   PRIVILEGE   REQUIRED  section  of  each  command
   description for details.
