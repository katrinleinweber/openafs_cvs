Template "L" line          AFS Commands       Template "L" line


NAME

   Template "L" line -- create hard link.


   L <existing-file> <link>

DESCRIPTION

   Creates  a "hard link" between two files, as achieved by the
   standard Unix ln command.  An explanation of links is beyond
   the  scope  of  this  document,  but  the basic effect is to
   create a second name for an existing file, so that it can be
   accessed  via either name.  It does not create a second copy
   of the file.

   AFS allows hard links only between files that reside in  the
   same  directory.  This restriction is necessary to eliminate
   the  confusion  that  would  result  from  associating   two
   potentially  different  ACLs  (those of the two directories)
   with the same file.    However,  symbolic  links  are  legal
   between  two  files that reside in different directories and
   even volumes (see the section on the template "S" line).

   "L" lines should appear in the  template  after  "D"  lines;
   they should also appear after "F" and "E" lines if either of
   the files being linked were created on such  a  line.    Any
   number of "L" lines may appear in a template.

ARGUMENTS

   L               should  be  a  capital  letter and tells the
                   command interpreter  that  this  instruction
                   creates a hard link.

   existing-file   is  the  complete  pathname  of the existing
                   file.

   link            is the complete pathname of the second  name
                   for the file.

EXAMPLE

   The  following  links  the file mail to the file mbox in the
   home directory.

      L $MTPT/mbox $MTPT/mail
