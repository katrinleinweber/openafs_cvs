DESCRIPTION

   Displays  information  about  the  volume  containing   each
   specified  directory  or file.  The information includes the
   file's quota and current size.  See the OUTPUT section for a
   complete  explanation  of  the  information provided.  While
   this command provides the most information about  a  volume,
   the fs listquota and fs quota commands are also available to
   display information about a volume.

ARGUMENTS

   -path specifies  each  file  and/or  directory   for   which
         information  about  the  host volume is desired.  Omit
         this switch to display information  about  the  volume
         that contains the current working directory.

   -help prints the online help entry for this command.  Do not
         provide any other arguments or flags  with  this  one.
         See  section  3.1  in  the  Reference  Manual for more
         details.

OUTPUT

   Note: The partition-related  numbers  that  appear  in  this
   output  may  not always agree with the corresponding numbers
   in the output of the standard UNIX df  command.    The  main
   reason   is  that  the  df  output  reflects  the  state  of
   partitions exactly when the command is issued.  The  numbers
   in  this command's output may be up to 5 minutes old, as the
   Cache  Manager  polls  the   File   Server   for   partition
   information   at   that   frequency.      Another  potential
   difference: the partition  size  reported  by  the  UNIX  df
   command  includes  some reserved space that does not show up
   in this report of partition size, and so  is  likely  to  be
   about 10% larger.



   The  output  reports  the  following  information about each
   volume that contains a specified directory or file:

      - the volumeID number (abbreviated in the output  as
        "vid") of the volume

      - the volume's name

      - the  current "offline" message associated with the
        volume, as set by a system administrator using the
        fs setvol command

      - the  current  "message of the day" associated with
        the volume, as set by a system administrator using
        the fs setvol command

      - the  volume's  maximum  size  quota,  in  kilobyte
        blocks

      - its current size, in kilobyte blocks

      - the number of kilobyte blocks still  available  on
        the  disk partition that houses the volume and the
        partition's total size

EXAMPLES

   The following shows the output  for  the  volume  user.smith
   (and  the  partition housing it) in the Transarc Corporation
   cell:

       % fs exa /afs/transarc.com/usr/smith
       Volume status for vid = 50489902 named user.smith
       Current maximum quota is 15000
       Current blocks used are 5073
       The partition has 46383 blocks available out of 333305

PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

   None.
