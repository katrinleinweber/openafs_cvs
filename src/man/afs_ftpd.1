NAME

   ftpd  (AFS  version) -- initialize  Internet  File Transfer

                       Protocol server.


   /usr/etc/ftpd  [-d]  [-l]  [-ttimeout]

DESCRIPTION

   Functions like the standard UNIX ftpd, except that  it  also
   authenticates   the  issuer  of  the  ftp  command  (who  is
   presumably  working  on   a   remote   machine)   with   the
   Authentication  Server  in  the local cell (the home cell of
   the machine where ftpd is running).  The  authentication  is
   based  on  the  user  name  and password provided at the ftp
   prompts on the remote machine.  The  Cache  Manager  on  the
   machine   running  ftpd  stores  the  newly  created  token,
   identifying it by PAG rather than by the user's UNIX UID.

   The issuer of ftp may be working in a foreign cell, as  long
   as the user name and password provided are valid in the cell
   where ftpd is running.

   If the user name under which ftp is issued does not exist in
   the  Authentication  Database  for  the  cell  where ftpd is
   running, or the issuer provides  the  wrong  password,  then
   ftpd  logs the user into the UNIX file system of the machine
   where ftpd is running.  The  success  of  this  local  login
   depends  on  the  user  name appearing in the local password
   file and on the user providing the correct  local  password.
   In  the case of a local login, AFS server processes consider
   the issuer of ftp to be anonymous.

   In the configuration recommended  by  Transarc  Corporation,
   the  AFS  version  of  ftpd  is substituted for the standard
   version (only one of the versions can run at  a  time).  The
   administrator then has two choices:

      - name the binary for the AFS version something like
        ftpd.afs, leaving the standard  version  as  ftpd.
        Change   inetd.conf  to  refer  to  ftpd.afs;  the
        standard version is not referenced.

      - name the binary  for  the  AFS  version  ftpd  and
        rename  the  binary  for  the  standard version to
        something like ftpd.old.  No change to  inetd.conf
        is  necessary,  but  it is not as obvious that the
        standard version of ftpd is no longer in use.
