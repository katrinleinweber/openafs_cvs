Template "X" line          AFS Commands       Template "X" line


NAME

   Template "X" line -- execute command.


   X <command>

DESCRIPTION

   Executes the indicated command, which may be a standard UNIX
   or AFS command.    The  command  may  include  any  standard
   template  variables,  which the uss command interpreter will
   resolve before passing the command  on  to  the  appropriate
   other command interpreter.

   "X" lines should appear in the template after the definition
   of any elements they affect or variables they refer to.  Any
   number  of  "X"  lines  may appear in a template.  Each line
   must be a single line only (cannot contain carriage  returns
   or new line characters within the <command> field).

ARGUMENTS

   X               should  be  a  capital  letter and tells the
                   command interpreter  that  this  instruction
                   executes a command.

   command         is  the command to be executed.  Surround it
                   with  double  quotes  in  case  it  contains
                   spaces.  It may contain variables, which the
                   command  interpreter  will  resolve   before
                   executing  the  command, but may not contain
                   carriage returns (newline characters).

EXAMPLE

   The following,  appropriate  for  the  Transarc  Corporation
   cell,  mounts the Backup version of the user's volume at the
   OldFiles subdirectory.
