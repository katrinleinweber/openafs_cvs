To build the AFS kernel module on a local system, run:

    ./configure
    make

When it's done, the binary module will be src/MODLOAD-XXX/libafs-XXX.o
and must be manually installed for your kernel.  To do this you
generally copy the file to /usr/vice/etc/modload:

    cp src/MODLOAD-XXX/libafs-XXX.o /usr/vice/etc/modload/

Then you need to add this module to your SymTable by using "afsmodname"
to generate a new SymTable:

    cd /usr/vice/etc/modload
    ../afsmodname -f SymTable.local -g libafs-XXX.o

NOTE: This only works if you have your kernel compiled with symbol
version support.  Without symbol version support you will not be able
to choose kernel modules.  If you compile without kernel module
support then you need to remove the SymTable file from
/usr/vice/etc/modload to allow the init scripts to choose a module
based on 'uname -r' instead of /proc/ksyms.  Keep in mind that using
/proc/ksyms is MUCH better, so it is NOT recommended to use this
method!
