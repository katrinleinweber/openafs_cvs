    looping rxdebug and version amongst each other.
  * Install rxdebug (oops)
  * Fix lintian overrides to get Lintian to stop complaining about

  * Fix module package to not have build cruft
  * Use --disable-kernel-module option except for module sources
  * Attempt to build modules correctly, although still not in right place

    don't really know that much more than the kernel module and afsd
    work.  The pointer cast warnings are frightening.

 -- Sam Hartman <hartmans@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Jul 2001 11:41:22 -0400

openafs (1.0.90.20010704.snapshot-1) experimental; urgency=low

openafs (1.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, closes: #92776
  * Allow openafs-client to depend on openafs-modules-source not just
    openafs-modules.  This allows us to be installable on testing even
    without binary modules which may become a necessity given the current
    kernel image mess.

    actually solve that problem apparently. 


 -- Sam Hartman <hartmans@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Feb 2001 23:45:06 -0500

openafs (1.0.snap20001106-8) unstable; urgency=low

    This works better for AFS, even though it is not the way packages like
    alsa-base work.
  * Fix several typos in configuration scripts.
  * Clarify that it starts the client just after debconf.

 -- Sam Hartman <hartmans@mit.edu>  Wed, 29 Nov 2000 13:10:43 -0500

    records will be a while in the future.

    works  under fakeroot.  Important for modules package.

openafs (1.0.snap20001106-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Increase stacksize for server processes so they don't dump core.
  * New script: afs-rootvol--creates the root.afs and root.cell.  Works
    fairly well except that it is overly verbose and that it has my test
    cell hardcoded.  This script will evolve into part of a new cell
    config tool. 


  --
  * Support removing module for smP
  * Prune build directories out of modules sources--oops
  * Fix bogus depends for module sources--note that it really does want
    bison and flex at least for now.
