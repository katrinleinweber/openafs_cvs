This directory contains patches relative to the upstream OpenAFS source.
It is not used automatically as part of the build process and is not
guaranteed to be completely up-to-date; it is intended as documentation of
significant divergences, a place to store patches that should be sent
upstream, and a place to document the current status of patches.

Simple Debian-specific changes that aren't of interest to upstream will
not be included here, such as updating config.{guess,sub} or changing
paths to fit with the FHS.
