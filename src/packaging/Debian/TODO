* Get bos restrict working.

* The configuration transcript and the README.servers file would be best
  read together, but preferrably with some nicer formatting (such as HTML
  with a style sheet to set off the transcript in a different background
  color).

* Consider including the kdump executable in the kernel module package.
  openafs-client would have to provide a wrapper script to run the
  appropriate kdump and the kernel module package would need to install
  the kdump executable, maybe in /usr/lib/openafs, named after the kernel
  image installed.
