The inetd, rcp, rlogind and rsh directories contain AFS authentication (token)
passing support for their respective utilities. We are not removing these 
utilities as some sites may still be using them, but we *strongly discourage*
their use. These utilities don't encrypt user traffic, and they also don't
encrypt the AFS tokens. This means an attacker can capture the data and recover
a valid authentication token, and use it to perform authenticated operations.

Consider foregoing the rcmds altogether and using ssh. You can get Dug Song's
ssh patch to support AFS here:
http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/ssh-afs/
but you'll also need to install Kerberos 4 for libraries (which isn't a bad
idea anyhow). The KTH implementation includes the AFS helper library libkafs,
and so is desirable:
ftp://ftp.pdc.kth.se/pub/krb/src/

As a side effect, the insecure, but AFS aware ftpd included in AFS can be 
replaced by the ftpd included in the above-mentioned Kerberos package, as it
has RFC2228 security extensions. 

In any case, carefully consider the security implications before deploying 
these utilities.

To enable building of the insecure code included with OpenAFS, run
configure with the --enable-insecure switch.
