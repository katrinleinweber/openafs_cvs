<HR><H1><A NAME="HDRWQ601" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_535">Creating and Deleting User Accounts with the uss Command Suite</A></H1>
<P>The <B>uss</B> command suite helps you create and delete
AFS user accounts quickly and easily. You can create a single account
with the <B>uss add</B> command, delete a single account with the <B>uss
delete</B> command, or create and delete multiple accounts with the <B>uss
bulk</B> command.
<P>A single <B>uss add</B> or <B>uss bulk</B> command can create a
complete AFS user account because the <B>uss</B> command interpreter
refers to a template file in which you predefine the configuration of many
account components. The <B>uss delete</B> command deletes most of
the components of a user account, but does not use a template file.
<P>The <B>uss</B> suite also easily incorporates shell scripts or other
programs that you write to perform parts of account creation and deletion
unique to your site. To invoke a script or program automatically as a
<B>uss</B> command runs, use the appropriate instructions in the template
file or bulk input file. Various sections of this chapter discuss
possible uses for scripts.
<P>Using the <B>uss</B> commands to create and delete accounts is the
recommended method because it automates and correctly orders most of the
necessary steps. The alternative is to issue a series of separate
commands to the various AFS servers, which requires more careful record
keeping. For instructions, see <A HREF="auagd018.htm#HDRWQ662">Administering User Accounts</A>.
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ602" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_536">Summary of Instructions</A></H2>

<P><H3><A NAME="Header_538" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_538">The Components of an AFS User Account</A></H3>
<P>An AFS user account can have many components. The only two
required components are entries in the Protection Database and Authentication
Database, but the other components add functionality and usability. The
following information also appears in a corresponding section of <A HREF="auagd018.htm#HDRWQ662">Administering User Accounts</A>, but is repeated here for your convenience.
<UL>
<P><LI>A <I>Protection Database entry</I> defines the username (the name
provided when authenticating with AFS), and maps it to an AFS user ID (AFS
UID), a number that the AFS servers use internally when referencing
users. The Protection Database also tracks the groups to which the user
belongs. For details, see <A HREF="auagd019.htm#HDRWQ721">Administering the Protection Database</A>.
<P><LI>An <I>Authentication Database entry</I> records the user&#39;s AFS
password in a scrambled form suitable for use as an encryption key.
<P><LI>A home <I>volume</I> stores all the files in the user&#39;s home
directory together on a single partition of a file server machine. The
volume has an associated <VAR>quota</VAR> that limits its size. For a
complete discussion of volumes, see <A HREF="auagd010.htm#HDRWQ228">Managing Volumes</A>.
<P><LI>A <I>mount point</I> makes the contents of the user&#39;s volume
visible and accessible in the AFS filespace, and acts as the user&#39;s home
directory. For more details about mount points, see <A HREF="auagd010.htm#HDRWQ268">About Mounting Volumes</A>.
<P><LI>Full access permissions on the home directory&#39;s <I>access control
list (ACL)</I> and ownership of the directory (as displayed by the UNIX
<B>ls -ld</B> command) enable the user to manage his or her files.
For details on AFS file protection, see <A HREF="auagd020.htm#HDRWQ772">Managing Access Control Lists</A>.
<P><LI>A <I>local password file entry</I> (in the <B>/etc/passwd</B> file
or equivalent) of each AFS client machine enables the user to log in and
access AFS files through the Cache Manager. A subsequent section in
this chapter further discusses local password file entries.
<P><LI>Other optional <I>configuration files</I> make the account more
convenient to use. Such files help the user log in and log out more
easily, receive electronic mail, print, and so on.

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ608" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_540">Avoiding and Recovering from Errors and Interrupted Operations</A></H3>
<P>As for any complex operation, there are a number of possible
reasons that an account-creation or deletion operation can halt before it
completes. You can easily avoid several of the common reasons by making
the following checks before issuing a <B>uss</B> command&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>Verify that you have all of the administrative privileges you need to
complete an operation, as described in <A HREF="#HDRWQ607">Privilege Requirements for the uss Commands</A>. The instructions for using the <B>uss add</B>,
<B>uss delete</B>, and <B>uss bulk</B> commands include this check as
a step.
<P><LI>Proofread the template and bulk input files for correct syntax and
acceptable values. For discussion, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ617">Constructing a uss Template File</A> and <A HREF="#HDRWQ660">Constructing a Bulk Input File</A>.
<P><LI>Do not issue <B>uss</B> commands when you are aware of network, server
machine, or server process outages. Because <B>uss</B> operations
affect so many components of AFS, it is unlikely that the command can succeed
when there are outages.
</UL>
<P>Another way to avoid errors that halt an operation is to preview the
<B>uss</B> command by combining the <B>-dryrun</B> flag with the other
arguments to be used on the actual command. The <B>uss</B> command
interpreter generates a screen trace of the actions to be performed by the
actual command, without performing them.
<P>Using the <B>-dryrun</B> flag reveals many basic errors that can halt
an operation, particularly the ones due to incorrect syntax in the command
line, template file, or bulk input file. It does not catch all possible
errors, however, because the command interpreter is not actually attempting to
perform the actions it is tracing. For example, a Volume Server outage
does not necessarily halt the volume creation step when the <B>-dryrun</B>
flag is included, because the command interpreter is not actually contacting
the server; such an outage halts the actual creation operation.
<A NAME="IDX7595"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7596"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7597"></A>
<P>When the <B>uss</B> command interpreter encounters error conditions
minor enough that they do not require halting the operation, it usually
generates a message that begins with the string <TT>uss&#58;
Warning&#58;</TT> and describes the action it is taking to avoid
halting. For example, if a user&#39;s Protection Database entry
already exists, the following message appears on the standard output
stream&#58;
<PRE>   uss&#58; Warning&#58; User &#39;<VAR>user</VAR>&#39; already in the protection database
   The uid for user &#39;<VAR>user</VAR>&#39; is <VAR>AFS UID</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>If an error is more serious, the word <TT>Warning</TT> does not appear in
the message, which instead describes why the command interpreter cannot
perform the requested action. Not all of these errors cause the
<B>uss</B> operation to halt, but they still require you to take
corrective action. For example, attempting to create a mount point
fails if you lack the necessary permissions on the parent directory&#39;s
ACL, or if the mount point pathname in the <B>V</B> instruction&#39;s
<VAR>mount_point</VAR> field is malformed. However, this error does not
cause the creation operation to halt until later instructions in the template
attempt to install subdirectories or files under the nonexistent mount
point.
<P>If the command shell prompts returns directly after an error message, then
the error generally was serious enough to halt the operation. When an
error halts account creation or deletion, the best way to recover is to find
and fix the cause, and then reissue the same <B>uss</B> command.

<P>The following list describes what happens when components of a user&#39;s
account already exist when you reissue an account-creation command (the
<B>uss add</B> command, or the <B>uss bulk</B> command when the bulk
input file contains <B>add</B> instructions)&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>If the Protection Database entry already exists, a message confirms its
existence and specifies the associated AFS UID.
<P><LI>If the Authentication Database entry already exists, a message confirms
its existence.
<P><LI>If the volume and associated Volume Location Database (VLDB) entry already
exist, a message confirms their existence. However, the <B>uss</B>
command interpreter does alter the volume&#39;s quota, mount point, or ACL if
any of the relevant fields in the template <B>V</B> instruction have
changed since the command last ran. If the value in the
<VAR>mount_point</VAR> field has changed, the command interpreter creates the
new mount point but does not remove any existing mount points.
<P><LI>If any of the fields in the template <B>A</B> instruction have
changed, the <B>uss</B> command interpreter makes the changes without
comment.
<P><LI>If a directory, file, or link defined by a template file <B>D</B>,
<B>E</B>, <B>F</B>, <B>L</B>, or <B>S</B> instruction already
exists, the <B>uss</B> command interpreter replaces the existing element
with one that conforms to the template definition. To control whether
the <B>uss</B> command interpreter prompts for confirmation that you wish
to overwrite a given element, use the <B>-overwrite</B> flag to the
<B>uss add</B> or <B>uss bulk</B> command&#58; 
<UL>
<P><LI>If you include the <B>-overwrite</B> flag, the command interpreter
automatically overwrites all elements without asking for confirmation.
<P><LI>If you omit the flag, the command interpreter prompts once for each
account to ask if you want to overwrite all elements associated with
it.
</UL>
<P><LI>The command interpreter always reexecutes <B>X</B> instructions in the
template file. If a command&#39;s result already holds, reissuing it
has the same effect as reissuing it outside the context of the <B>uss</B>
commands.
</UL>
<P>The following describes what happens when a <B>uss delete</B> command
references account components that have already been deleted.
<UL>
<P><LI>If the volume and VLDB entry no longer exist, a message confirms their
absence.
<P><LI>If the Authentication Database entry no longer exists, a message confirms
its absence.

<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ609" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_541">Creating Local Password File Entries with uss</A></H2>
<P>To obtain authenticated access to a cell&#39;s AFS
filespace, a user must not only have a valid AFS token, but also an entry in
the local password file (<B>/etc/passwd</B> or equivalent) of the AFS
client machine. This section discusses why it is important for the
user&#39;s AFS UID to match to the UNIX UID listed in the local password
file, the appropriate value to put in the file&#39;s password field, and
outlines a method for creating a single source password file.
<P>For instructions on using the template file&#39;s <B>E</B> instruction
to generate local password file entries automatically as part of account
creation, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ612">Creating a Common Source Password File</A>.
<P>The following information also appears in a corresponding section of <A HREF="auagd018.htm#HDRWQ662">Administering User Accounts</A>, but is repeated here for your convenience.

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ610" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_542">Assigning AFS and UNIX UIDs that Match</A></H3>
<P>A user account is easiest to administer and use if the AFS
user ID number (AFS UID) and UNIX UID match. All instructions in the
AFS documentation assume that they do.
<P>The most basic reason to make AFS and UNIX UIDs the same is so that the
owner name reported by the UNIX <B>ls -l</B> and <B>ls -ld</B>
commands makes sense for AFS files and directories. Following standard
UNIX practice, the File Server records a number rather than a username in an
AFS file or directory&#39;s owner field&#58; the owner&#39;s AFS
UID. When you issue the <B>ls -l</B> command, it translates the UID
to a username according to the mapping in the local password file, not the AFS
Protection Database. If the AFS and UNIX UIDs do not match, the <B>ls
-l</B> command reports an unexpected (and incorrect) owner. The
output can even vary on different client machines if their local password
files map the same UNIX UID to different names.
<P>Follow the recommendations in the indicated sections to make AFS and UNIX
UIDs match when you are creating accounts for various types of users&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>If creating an AFS account for a user who already has a UNIX UID, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ613">Converting Existing UNIX Accounts with uss</A>.
<P><LI>If some users in your cell have existing UNIX accounts but the user for
whom you are creating an AFS account does not, then it is best to allow the
Protection Server to allocate an AFS UID automatically. To avoid
overlap of AFS UIDs with existing UNIX UIDs, set the Protection
Database&#39;s <TT>max user id</TT> counter higher than the largest UNIX
UID, using the instructions in <A HREF="auagd019.htm#HDRWQ770">Displaying and Setting the AFS UID and GID Counters</A>.
<P><LI>If none of your users have existing UNIX accounts, allow the Protection
Server to allocate AFS UIDs automatically, starting either at its default or
at the value you have set for the <TT>max user id</TT> counter.

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ611" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_543">Specifying Passwords in the Local Password File</A></H3>
<P>Authenticating with AFS is easiest for your users if you
install and configure an AFS-modified login utility, which logs a user into
the local file system and obtains an AFS token in one step. In this
case, the local password file no longer controls a user&#39;s ability to
login in most circumstances, because the AFS-modified login utility does not
consult the local password file if the user provides the correct AFS
password. You can nonetheless use a password file entry&#39;s password
field (usually, the second field) in the following ways to control login and
authentication&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>To prevent both local login and AFS authentication, place an asterisk ( *
) in the field. This is useful mainly in emergencies, when you want to
prevent a certain user from logging into the machine.
<P><LI>To prevent login to the local file system if the user does not provide the
correct AFS password, place a character string of any length other than the
standard thirteen characters in the field. This is appropriate if you
want to allow only people with local AFS accounts to log into to your
machines. A single <B>X</B> or other character is the most easily
recognizable way to do this.
<P><LI>To enable a user to log into the local file system even after providing an
incorrect AFS password, record a standard UNIX encrypted password in the field
by issuing the standard UNIX password-setting command (<B>passwd</B> or
equivalent).
</UL>
<P>If you do not use an AFS-modified login utility, you must place a standard
UNIX password in the local password file of every client machine the user will
use. The user logs into the local file system only, and then must issue
the <B>klog</B> command to authenticate with AFS. It is simplest if
the passwords in the local password file and the Authentication Database are
the same, but this is not required.

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ612" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_544">Creating a Common Source Password File</A></H3>
<P>This section explains how to create a common source version
of the local password file when using <B>uss</B> commands to create user
accounts. The sequence of steps is as follows&#58;
<OL TYPE=1>
<P><LI>Include an <B>E</B> instruction in the template file to create a
one-line file that has the format of a local password file entry.
<P><LI>Incorporate the one-line file into the common source version of the local
password file. It makes sense to store this file in AFS. See the
following two example scripts for automating this step.
<P><LI>Distribute the common password file to each client machine, perhaps by
using the AFS <B>package</B> utility as described in <A HREF="auagd016.htm#HDRWQ565">Configuring Client Machines with the package Program</A>.
</OL>
<P>As an example, the template file used by the ABC Corporation includes the
following <B>E</B> instruction to create a file called
<B>passwd_</B><VAR>username</VAR> in the directory
<B>/afs/.abc.com/common/etc/newaccts</B> (the entire
contents of the template file appear in <A HREF="#HDRWQ634">Example uss Templates</A> and a full description of the <B>E</B> instruction
appears in <A HREF="#HDRWQ639">Creating One-Line Files with the E Instruction</A>)&#58;

        "$USER&#58;X&#58;$UID&#58;11&#58;$NAME&#58;$MTPT&#58;/bin/csh"
</PRE>
<P>For the user Joe L. Smith with username <B>smith</B>, this
instruction creates a file called <B>passwd_smith</B> which contains the
following line&#58;
<PRE>   smith&#58;X&#58;1205&#58;11&#58;Joe L. Smith&#58;/afs/abc.com/usr/usr1/smith&#58;/bin/csh
</PRE>
<P>A shell script is probably the easiest way to incorporate a set of files
created in this manner into a common source password file, and two sample
shell scripts appear here. To automate the process even further, you
can create a <B>cron</B> process in a file server machine&#39;s
<B>/usr/afs/local/BosConfig</B> directory to execute the shell script,
perhaps each day at a given time; for details, see <A HREF="auagd009.htm#HDRWQ216">To create and start a new process</A>.
<TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><B>Note:</B></TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">The following example scripts are suggestions only. If you choose to
use them, or to model similar scripts on them, you must test that your script
has the desired result, preferably in a test environment.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><B>Example C Shell Script</B>
<P>The first example is a simple C shell script suitable for the ABC
Corporation cell. It incorporates the individual files found in the
<B>/afs/.abc.com/common/uss/newaccts</B> directory into a
new version of the global password file found in the
<B>/afs/.abc.com/common/etc</B> directory, sorting the files
into alphabetical order. It takes care to save the current version with
a <B>.old</B> extension, then removes the individual files when
done.
<PRE>   set  dir = /afs/.abc.com/common
   cat  $dir/uss/newaccts/passwd_* $dir/etc/passwd  >!  $dir/etc/passwd.new

   rm  $dir/etc/passwd.new  $dir/uss/newaccts/passwd_*
</PRE>
<P><B>Example Bourne Shell Script</B>
<P>The second, more elaborate, example is a Bourne shell script that first
verifies that there are new <B>passwd_</B><VAR>username</VAR> files to be
incorporated into the global password file. While running, it checks
that each new entry does not already exist. Like the shorter C shell
example, it incorporates the individual files found in the
<B>/afs/.abc.com/common/uss/newaccts</B> directory into a
new version of the global <B>passwd</B> file found in the
<B>/afs/.abc.com/common/etc</B> directory.

argument.
<P><LI>If using the <B>uss bulk</B> command, specify the desired UID in the

</UL> 
<P>Because you are retaining the user&#39;s UNIX UID, you do not need to
alter the UID in the local password file entry. However, if you are
using an AFS-modified login utility, you possibly need to change the password
field in the entry. For a discussion of how the value in the password
field affects login with an AFS-modified login utility, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ609">Creating Local Password File Entries with uss</A>. 
<P>If now or in the future you need to create AFS accounts for users who do
not have an existing UNIX UID, then you must guarantee that new AFS UIDs do
not conflict with any existing UNIX UIDs. The simplest way is to set
the <TT>max user id</TT> counter in the Protection Database to a value
higher than the largest existing UNIX UID. See <A HREF="auagd019.htm#HDRWQ770">Displaying and Setting the AFS UID and GID Counters</A>.
<P><LI>Change the existing UNIX UIDs to match the new AFS UIDs that the
Protection Server assigns automatically. 
<P>Allow the Protection Server to allocate the AFS UIDs automatically as you
create AFS accounts. For instructions on creating a new entry for the
local password file during account creation, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ609">Creating Local Password File Entries with uss</A>. 
<P>There is one drawback to changing the UNIX UID&#58; any files and
directories that the user owned in the local file system before becoming an
AFS user still have the former UID in their owner field. If you want
the <B>ls -l</B> and <B>ls -ld</B> commands to display the correct
owner, you must use the <B>chown</B> command to change the value to the
user&#39;s new UID, whether you are leaving the file in the local file system
or moving it to AFS. See <A HREF="#HDRWQ616">Moving Local Files into AFS</A>.
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ615" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_547">Setting the Password Field Appropriately</A></H3>
<P>Existing UNIX accounts already have an entry in the local
password file, probably with a (scrambled) password in the password
field. You possibly need to change the value in the field, depending on
the type of login utility you use&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>If the login utility is not modified for use with AFS, the actual password
must appear (in scrambled form) in the password field of the local password

<P><LI>If the login utility is modified for use with AFS, choose one of the
acceptable values, each of which affects the login utility&#39;s behavior
differently. See <A HREF="#HDRWQ609">Creating Local Password File Entries with uss</A>.
</UL>
<P>If you choose to place an actual password in a local password file entry,
then you can define a dummy password when you use a template file <B>E</B>
instruction to create the entry, as described in <A HREF="#HDRWQ639">Creating One-Line Files with the E Instruction</A>. Have the user issue the UNIX password-setting
command (<B>passwd</B> or equivalent) to replace the dummy with an actual
secret password.
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ616" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_548">Moving Local Files into AFS</A></H3>
<P>New AFS users with existing UNIX accounts probably already
own files and directories stored in a machine&#39;s local file system, and it
usually makes sense to transfer them into the new home volume. The
easiest method is to move them onto the local disk of an AFS client machine,
and then use the UNIX <B>mv</B> command to transfer them into the
user&#39;s new AFS home directory.
<P>As you move files and directories into AFS, keep in mind that the meaning
of their mode bits changes. AFS ignores the second and third sets of
mode bits (group and other), and does not use the first set (the owner bits)
directly, but only in conjunction with entries on the ACL (for details, see <A HREF="auagd020.htm#HDRWQ795">How AFS Interprets the UNIX Mode Bits</A>). Be sure that the ACL protects the file or directory
at least as securely as the mode bits.
<P>If you have chosen to change a user&#39;s UNIX UID to match a new AFS UID,
you must change the ownership of UNIX files and directories as well.
Only members of the <B>system&#58;administrators</B> group can issue the

<P>Creating user accounts with <B>uss</B> commands is
generally more convenient than using individual commands. You control
the account creation process just as closely, but the <B>uss</B> template
file enables you to predefine many aspects of account configuration.
Because you construct the template before issuing <B>uss</B> commands, you
have time to consider configuration details carefully and correct syntax
errors. The following list summarizes some further advantages of using
a template&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>You do not have to remember the correct order in which to create or delete
account components, or the order of each command&#39;s arguments, which
reduces the likelihood of errors.
<P><LI>You do not have to type the same information multiple times.
Instead, you can place constants and variables in the template file that
enable you to type as little on the command line as possible. See <A HREF="#HDRWQ619">Using Constants and Variables in the Template File</A>.
<P><LI>You can create different templates for different types of users.
Instead of having to remember which components differ for a given user,
specify the appropriate template when issuing the <B>uss add</B> or
<B>uss bulk</B> command.
<P><LI>You can create any of the three types of AFS account (authentication-only,
basic, or full) by including or omitting certain information in the template,
as described in <A HREF="#HDRWQ618">Creating the Three Types of User Accounts</A>.

<P>The following list briefly describes the instructions that can appear in a

lists them in the order that is usually optimal for correct handling of
dependencies between the different types of instruction.
<DL>
<P><DT><B><B>G</B>
</B><DD>Defines a directory that is one of a set of parent directories into which
the <B>uss</B> command interpreter evenly distributes newly created home

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ619" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_551">Using Constants and Variables in the Template File</A></H3>
<P>Each instruction in the <B>uss</B> template file has
several fields that define the characteristics of the element that it
creates. The <B>D</B> instruction&#39;s fields, for instance,
define a directory&#39;s pathname, owner, mode bits, and ACL.
<P>You can place three types of values in a field&#58; a variable, a
constant, or a combination of the two. The appropriate value depends on
the desired configuration, and determines which arguments you provide to the
<B>uss add</B> command or which fields you include in a bulk input file
<B>add</B> instruction.
<P>If an aspect of account configuration is the same for every user, define a
constant value in the appropriate field by inserting a character
string. For example, to assign a space quota of 10,000 KB to every user
volume, place the string <B>10000</B> in the <B>V</B>
instruction&#39;s <VAR>quota</VAR> field.
<P>If, on the other hand, an aspect of account configuration varies for each
user, put a variable in the appropriate field. When creating each
account, provide a value for the variable by providing either the
corresponding argument to the <B>uss add</B> command or a value in the
corresponding field of the <B>add</B> instruction in the bulk input
file.
<P>The <B>uss</B> command suite defines a set of template variables, each

<P>A common use of variables is to define the file server machine and
partition that house the user&#39;s volume, which often vary from user to
user. Place the $SERVER variable in the <B>V</B> instruction&#39;s
<VAR>server</VAR> field, and the $PART variable in its <VAR>partition</VAR>
field. If using the <B>uss add</B> command, provide the desired
value with the <B>-server</B> and <B>-partition</B> arguments.
If using the <B>uss bulk</B> command, provide the desired values in the
<VAR>file_server</VAR> and <VAR>partition</VAR> fields of each user&#39;s
<B>add</B> instruction in the bulk input file.
<A NAME="IDX7630"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7631"></A>
<P>The variables $1 through $9 can be used to customize other aspects of the
account. Provide a value for these variables with the <B>-var</B>
argument to the <B>uss add</B> command or in the appropriate field of the
bulk input file <B>add</B> instruction. The <B>-var</B>
argument is unusual in that each instance for it has two parts&#58; the
number index and the value, separated by a space. For examples of the
use of a number variable, see the discussions of the <VAR>mount_point</VAR> and
<VAR>quota</VAR> fields in <A HREF="#HDRWQ636">Creating a Volume with the V Instruction</A>.
<P>If some aspect of account configuration is partly constant and partly
variable, you can combine variables and constants in an instruction
field. For example, suppose that the ABC Corporation mounts user
volumes in the <B>/afs/abc.com/usr</B> directory. That part
of the pathname is constant, but the name of the mount point and home
directory is the user&#39;s username, which corresponds to the $USER
variable. To configure accounts in this way, combine a constant string
and a variable in the <B>V</B> instruction&#39;s <VAR>mount_point</VAR>
field as follows&#58;
<PRE>   /afs/abc.com/usr/$USER
</PRE>
<P>Then provide the value for the $USER variable with the <B>-user</B>
argument to the <B>uss add</B> command, or in the <VAR>username</VAR> field
of each user&#39;s <B>add</B> instruction in the bulk input file.

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ631" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_552">Where to Place Template Files</A></H3>
<P>A template must be available to the <B>uss</B> command
interpreter as it executes a <B>uss add</B> or <B>uss bulk</B>
command, even if it is the zero-length file appropriate for creating an
authentication-only account.
<P>If you do not provide the <B>-template</B> argument to the <B>uss
add</B> or <B>uss bulk</B> command, then the command interpreter
searches for a template file called <B>uss.template</B> in each of
the following directories in turn&#58;
<OL TYPE=1>
<P><LI>The current working directory
<P><LI><B>/afs/<VAR>cellname</VAR>/common/uss</B>, where <VAR>cellname</VAR> is

<P>To use a template file with a different name or stored in a different
directory, include the <B>-template</B> argument to the <B>uss add</B>
or <B>uss bulk</B> command. If you provide a filename only, the
command interpreter looks for it in the directories listed just

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ632" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_553">Some General Rules for Constructing a Template</A></H3>
<P>This section summarizes some general rules to follow when
constructing a template file. For each instruction&#39;s syntax
definition, see the following sections (<A HREF="#HDRWQ635">Evenly Distributing User Home Directories with the G Instruction</A> through <A HREF="#HDRWQ642">Executing Commands with the X Instruction</A>).
<UL>
<P><LI>If a variable takes its value from an element elsewhere within the
template, the definition must precede the reference. Putting the
instruction lines in the following order usually results in correct resolution
of variables&#58;
<P><B>G  V  D  F  E  L  S  A X</B>
<P><LI>The fields in each instruction must appear in the order specified by the
instruction&#39;s syntax definition, which appear in the following sections
about each instruction. You cannot omit a field. Separate each
field from its neighbors with one or more spaces.
<P><LI>When specifying a pathname, provide a full one. Partial pathnames
are interpreted relative to the current working directory (the one in which
the <B>uss</B> command is issued), with possibly unintended
results.
<P><LI>Each instruction must appear on a single line in the template file, with a
newline character (<B>&lt;Return></B>) only at the end of the
instruction. Some example instructions appear in this document on more
than one line, but that is only for legibility.
<P><LI>Provide a value for every variable that appears in the template by
including the corresponding argument to the <B>uss add</B> command or
placing a value in the corresponding field of the bulk input file
<B>add</B> instruction. A missing value halts the entire creation
operation. If a variable does not appear in the template file, the
command interpreter ignores the corresponding command-line argument or field
in the bulk input file, even if you provide it.
<P><LI>You can use blank lines in the template file to increase its
legibility. If you place comments in the file, begin each comment line
with the number sign (<B>#</B>).
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ633" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_554">About Creating Local Disk Directories and Files</A></H3>
<P>It is possible to use the <B>D</B>, <B>E</B>, and
<B>F</B> instructions to create directories or files in the local file
system of the machine on which you are issuing the <B>uss</B> command, but
that usage is not recommended. It introduces two potential
complications&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>The local file system automatically assigns ownership of a new local disk
directory or file to its creator. Because you are the issuer of the
<B>uss</B> command that is creating the object, it records your current
UNIX UID. If that is not appropriate and you want to designate another
owner as the object is created, then you must be logged in as the local
superuser <B>root</B> (the local file system allows only the
<B>root</B> user to issue the UNIX <B>chown</B> command, which the
<B>uss</B> command interpreter invokes to change the owner from the
default value). You must also use the <B>-admin</B> argument to the
<B>uss add</B> or <B>uss bulk</B> command to authenticate as a
privileged AFS administrator. Only an administrator can create
Authentication Database and Protection Database entries, which the
<B>uss</B> command interpreter always creates as part of a new
account. 
<P>The alternative is to become the local superuser <B>root</B> after the
<B>uss</B> operation completes, and issue the necessary <B>chown</B>
command then. However, that makes the account creation process that
much less automated.
<P><LI>Creating a local disk directory always generates an error message because
the <B>uss</B> command interpreter cannot successfully set a local
directory&#39;s ACL. The directory is created nevertheless, and a
value still must appear in the <B>D</B> instruction&#39;s <VAR>ACL</VAR>
field.
</UL>
<P>The recommended method for configuring a machine&#39;s local disk is to
use the AFS <B>package</B> utility instead; see <A HREF="auagd016.htm#HDRWQ565">Configuring Client Machines with the package Program</A>.

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ634" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_555">Example uss Templates</A></H3>
<P>This section describes example templates for the basic and
full account types (the template for an authentication-only account is
empty).
<P>The first example creates a basic account. It contains two
<B>G</B> instructions and a <B>V</B> instruction that defines the
volume name, file server machine, partition, quota in kilobytes, mount point,
home directory owner, and home directory access control list. In the
ABC Corporation cell, a suitable template is&#58;
<PRE>   G /afs/.abc.com/usr1
   G /afs/.abc.com/usr2
   V  user.$USER  $SERVER.abc.com  /vicep$PART  5000  $AUTO/$USER   $UID  \

provide the following arguments&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI><B>-user</B> to specify the username for the $USER variable
<P><LI><B>-server</B> to specify the unique part of the file server machine
name for the $SERVER variable
<P><LI><B>-partition</B> to specify the unique part of the partition name for
the $PART variable

<P>The Protection Server automatically assigns an AFS UID for the $UID
variable, and the <B>G</B> instructions provide a value for the $AUTO
variable.
<P>The following example template file creates a full account in the ABC

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ635" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_556">Evenly Distributing User Home Directories with the G Instruction</A></H3>
<P>In cells with thousands of user accounts, it often makes
sense to distribute the mount points for user volumes into multiple parent
directories, because placing them all in one directory noticeably slows down
directory lookup when a user home directory is accessed. A possible
solution is to create parent directories that group user home directories
alphabetically, or that reflect divisions like academic or corporate
departments. However, in a really large cell, some such groups can
still be large enough to slow directory lookup, and users who belong to those
groups are unfairly penalized every time they access their home
directory. Another drawback to groupings that reflect workplace
divisions is that you must move mount points when users change departmental
affiliation.
<P>An alternative is an even distribution of user home directories into
multiple parent directories that do not represent workplace divisions.
The <B>uss</B> command suite enables you to define a list of directories
by placing a <B>G</B> instruction for each one at the top of the template
file, and then using the $AUTO variable in the <B>V</B> instruction&#39;s
<VAR>mount_point</VAR> field. When the <B>uss</B> command interpreter
encounters the $AUTO variable, it substitutes the directory named by a
<B>G</B> instruction that currently has the fewest entries.
(Actually, the $AUTO variable can appear in any field that includes a
pathname, in any type of instruction. In all cases, the command
interpreter substitutes the directory that currently has the fewest
entries.)
<P>The <B>G</B> instruction&#39;s syntax is as follows&#58;
<PRE>   G  <VAR>directory</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>where <VAR>directory</VAR> specifies either a complete directory pathname or
only the final element (the directory itself). The choice determines
the appropriate value to place in the <B>V</B> instruction&#39;s
<VAR>mount_point</VAR> field.
<P>Specify the read/write path to each directory, to avoid the failure that
results when you attempt to create a new mount point in a read-only
volume. By convention, you indicate the read/write path by placing a
period before the cell name at the pathname&#39;s second level (for example,
<B>/afs/.abc.com</B>). For further discussion of the
concept of read/write and read-only paths through the filespace, see <A HREF="auagd010.htm#HDRWQ293">Mounting Volumes</A>.
<P>For example, the ABC Corporation example template for a full account in <A HREF="#HDRWQ634">Example uss Templates</A> defines two directories&#58;
<PRE>   G /afs/.abc.com/usr1
   G /afs/.abc.com/usr2
</PRE>
<P>and puts the value <B>$AUTO/$USER</B> in the <B>V</B>
instruction&#39;s <VAR>mount_point</VAR> field. An alternative with the
same result is to define the directories as follows&#58;
<PRE>   G usr1
   G usr2
</PRE>
<P>and specify a more complete pathname in the <B>V</B> instruction&#39;s
<VAR>mount_point</VAR> field&#58;
<B>/afs/.abc.com/$AUTO/$USER</B>.

<P>Unless the template file is empty (zero-length), one and
only one <B>V</B> instruction must appear in it. (To create other
volumes for a user as part of a <B>uss</B> account-creation operation, use
the <B>X</B> instruction to invoke the <B>vos create</B> command or a
script that invokes that command along with others, such as the <B>fs
mkmount</B> command. For an example, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ642">Executing Commands with the X Instruction</A>.)
<P>The <B>V</B> instruction defines the following AFS entities&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>A volume and associated VLDB entry
<P><LI>The volume&#39;s site (file server machine and partition)
<P><LI>The volume&#39;s mount point in the AFS filespace, which becomes the
user&#39;s home directory
<P><LI>The volume&#39;s space quota
<P><LI>The home directory&#39;s owner, usually the new user
<P><LI>The home directory&#39;s ACL, which normally at least grants all
permissions to the user
</UL>
<P>The following discussion of the fields in a <B>V</B> instruction refers
to the example in the full account template from <A HREF="#HDRWQ634">Example uss Templates</A> (the instruction appears here on two lines only for
legibility)&#58;
<PRE>   V  user.$USER  $SERVER.abc.com  /vicep$PART  5000  \

</PRE>
<P>The <B>V</B> instruction&#39;s syntax is as follows&#58;
<PRE>   V  <VAR>volume_name</VAR>  <VAR>server</VAR>  <VAR>partition</VAR>  <VAR>quota</VAR>  <VAR>mount_point</VAR> <VAR>owner</VAR>  <VAR>ACL</VAR>

<DL>
<P><DT><B><B>V</B>
</B><DD>Indicates a volume creation instruction.
<P><DT><B><VAR>volume_name</VAR>
</B><DD>Specifies the volume&#39;s name as recorded in the VLDB.
<P>To follow the convention of including the user&#39;s name as part of the
volume name, include the $USER variable in this field. The variable
takes its value from the <B>-user</B> argument to the <B>uss add</B>
command or from the bulk input file <B>add</B> instruction&#39;s
<VAR>username</VAR> field.
<P>The ABC Corporation example uses the value <B>user.$USER</B> to
assign the conventional volume name,
<B>user.</B><VAR>username</VAR>. When creating an account for
user <B>smith</B>, for example, you then include <B>-user smith</B> as
an argument to the <B>uss add</B> command, or place the value
<B>smith</B> in the bulk input file <B>add</B> instruction&#39;s
<VAR>username</VAR> field.
<P><DT><B><VAR>server</VAR>
</B><DD>Names the file server machine on which to create the new volume. It
is best to provide a fully qualified host name (for example,
<B>fs1.abc.com</B>), but an abbreviated form is acceptable
if the cell&#39;s naming service is available to resolve it at the time the
volume is created.
<P>To place different users&#39; volumes on different file server machines,
use the $SERVER variable in this field, and provide a value for it either with
the <B>-server</B> argument to the <B>uss add</B> command or in the
<VAR>server</VAR> field of the bulk input file <B>add</B>
instruction. One easy way to specify a fully qualified hostname without
having to type it completely on the command line is to combine a constant and
the $SERVER variable. Specifically, the constant specifies the
domain-name suffix common to all the file server machines.
<P>In the ABC Corporation example, all of the file server machines in the cell
share the <B>abc.com</B> domain name suffix, so the <VAR>server</VAR>
field combines a variable and constant&#58;
<B>$SERVER.abc.com</B>. To place the new volume on
the machine <B>fs1.abc.com</B>, you then include
<B>-server fs1</B> as an argument to the <B>uss add</B> command, or
place the value <B>fs1</B> in the bulk input file <B>add</B>
instruction&#39;s <VAR>server</VAR> field.
<P><DT><B><VAR>partition</VAR>
</B><DD>Specifies the partition on which to create the user&#39;s volume; it
must be on the file server machine named in the <VAR>server</VAR> field.
Identify the partition by its complete name (for example, <B>/vicepa</B>)
or use one of the abbreviations listed in <A HREF="auagd023.htm#HDRWQ840">Rules for Using Abbreviations and Aliases</A>.
<P>To place different users&#39; volumes on different partitions, use the
$PART variable in this field, and provide a value for it either with the
<B>-partition</B> argument to the <B>uss add</B> command or in the
<VAR>partition</VAR> field of the bulk input file <B>add</B>
instruction. Because all full partition names start with the
<B>/vicep</B> string, it is convenient to combine that string as a
constant with the $PART variable.
<P>The ABC Corporation example template combines the constant string
<B>/vicep</B> and the $PART variable in this way, as
<B>/vicep$PART</B>.

assign the same quota to all user volumes, specify a constant value. To
assign different quotas to different volumes, place one of the number
variables ($1 through $9) in this field, and provide a value for it either
with the <B>-var</B> argument to the <B>uss add</B> command or in the
appropriate field of the bulk input file <B>add</B> instruction.

<P><DT><B><VAR>mount_point</VAR>
</B><DD>Creates a mount point for the volume, which serves as the volume&#39;s
root directory and the user&#39;s home directory. By convention, user
home directory names include the username, which you can read in by including
the $USER variable in this field.
<P>Specify the read/write path to the mount point, to avoid the failure that
results when you attempt to create the new mount point in a read-only
volume. By convention, you indicate the read/write path by placing a
period before the cell name at the pathname&#39;s second level (for example,
<B>/afs/.abc.com</B>). If you use the $AUTO variable
in this field, the directories named by each <B>G</B> instruction possibly
already indicate the read/write path. For further discussion of the
concept of read/write and read-only paths through the filespace, see <A HREF="auagd010.htm#HDRWQ293">Mounting Volumes</A>.
<P>If other parts of the mount point name also vary from user to user, you can
use the $MTPT variable in this field, and provide a value with the <B>uss
add</B> command&#39;s <B>-mount</B> argument or in the
<VAR>mount_point</VAR> field of a bulk input file <B>add</B>
instruction. Note, however, that when the $MTPT variable appears in
subsequent instructions in the template (usually, in <B>D</B>,
<B>E</B>, or <B>F</B> instructions), it instead takes as its value the
complete contents of this field.
<P>Combine constants and variables based on how you have decided to group home
directories together in one or more parent directories. Note that the
parent directories must already exist before you run a <B>uss add</B> or
<B>uss bulk</B> command that references the template. Possibilities
for grouping home directories include the following&#58;
<A NAME="IDX7657"></A>
<P>
<UL>
<P><LI>Placing all user home directories in a single parent directory; the
name <B>/afs/</B><VAR>cellname</VAR><B>/usr</B> is an AFS-appropriate
variation on the UNIX <B>/usr</B> convention. This choice is most
appropriate for a cell with a small number of user accounts. The
simplest way to implement this choice is to combine a constant string and the
$USER variable, as in <B>/afs/.abc.com/usr/$USER</B>.
<P><LI>Distributing home directories evenly into a set of parent directories that
do not correspond to workplace divisions. This choice is appropriate in
cells with tens of thousands of accounts, where the number of home directories
is large enough to slow directory lookup significantly if they all reside
together in one parent directory, but distribution according to workplace
divisions is not feasible.
<P>The $AUTO variable is designed to distribute home directories evenly in
this manner. As explained in <A HREF="#HDRWQ635">Evenly Distributing User Home Directories with the G Instruction</A>, the <B>uss</B> command interpreter substitutes the
directory that is defined by a preceding <B>G</B> template instruction and
that currently has the fewest entries. The example ABC Corporation
template illustrates this choice by using the value
<B>/afs/.abc.com/$AUTO/$USER</B>.
<P><LI>Distributing home directories into multiple directories that reflect
divisions like academic or corporate departments. Perhaps the simplest
way to implement this scheme is to use the $MTPT variable to represent the
department, as in
<B>/afs/.ghi.com/usr/$MTPT/$USER</B>. You then
provide <B>-user smith</B> and <B>-mount acctg</B> arguments to the
<B>uss add</B> command to create the mount point
<B>/afs/.ghi.com/usr/acctg/smith</B>.
<P><LI>Distributing home directories into alphabetic subdirectories of
<B>usr</B> (<B>usr/a</B>, <B>usr/b</B> and so on), based on the
first letter or letters in the username. The advantage is that knowing
the username enables you easily to locate a home directory. A potential
drawback is that the distribution is not likely to be even, and if there are a
large number of accounts, then slowed directory lookup unfairly affects users
whose names begins with popular letters. 
<P>Perhaps the simplest way to implement this scheme is to use the $MTPT
variable to represent the letter or letters, as in
<B>/afs/.jkl.com/usr/$MTPT/$USER</B>. Then provide
the <B>-user smith</B> and <B>-mount s/m</B> arguments to the <B>uss
add</B> command to create the mount point
<B>/afs/.jkl.com/usr/s/m/smith</B>.
</UL>
<P><DT><B><VAR>owner</VAR>
</B><DD>Specifies the username or UID of the user to be designated the mount
point&#39;s owner in the output from the UNIX <B>ls -ld</B>

ownership, use the $UID variable in this field, as in the ABC Corporation
example template. The Protection Server then automatically assigns an
AFS UID unless you provide the <B>-uid</B> argument to the <B>uss
add</B> command or fill in the <VAR>uid</VAR> field in the bulk input file

<P>Each <B>E</B> instruction in the template file creates a
file by echoing a specified single line into it; there is no limit on the
number of them in the template. If an <B>E</B> instruction creates
a file in a new user&#39;s home directory or a subdirectory of it (the
intended use), then it must follow the <B>V</B> or <B>D</B>
instruction that creates the parent directory. Creating a file on the
local disk of the machine where the <B>uss</B> command runs is not
recommended for the reasons detailed in <A HREF="#HDRWQ633">About Creating Local Disk Directories and Files</A>.
<P>The <B>F</B> instruction also creates a file, but the two types of
instruction have complementary advantages. Files created with an
<B>E</B> instruction can be customized for each user, because variables
can appear in the field that specifies the contents of the file. The
command interpreter replaces the variables with appropriate values before
creating the file. In contrast, the contents of a file created using
the <B>F</B> instruction are the same for every user. An
<B>E</B> file can be only a single line, however, whereas an <B>F</B>
file can be any length.
<P>The <B>E</B> instruction is particularly suited to creating an entry
for the new user in the cell&#39;s common source password file, which is then
copied to client machines to serve as the local password file
(<B>/etc/passwd</B> or equivalent). The following discussion of the
fields refers to an example of this type of use, from the ABC
Corporation&#39;s full account template shown in <A HREF="#HDRWQ634">Example uss Templates</A>. For further discussion of how to
incorporate the files created in this way into a common source password file,

<B>/afs/.abc.com</B>). If you use the $MTPT variable

<P>The ABC Corporation example is creating an AFS file intended for
incorporation into the common password file, rather than for direct use by the

as the owner of the new file. Designating an alternate owner on an AFS
file does not introduce complications&#58; issuing the <B>chown</B>

<P>Each <B>L</B> instruction in the template file creates a
hard link between two files, as achieved by the standard UNIX <B>ln</B>
command. The <B>S</B> instruction creates a symbolic link between
two files, as achieved by the standard UNIX <B>ln -s</B> command.
An explanation of links is beyond the scope of this document, but the basic
effect in both cases is to create a second name for an existing file, so that
it can be accessed via either name. Creating a link does not create a
second copy of the file.
<P>There is no limit on the number of <B>L</B> or <B>S</B>
instructions in a template file. If the link is in a new user&#39;s
home directory or a subdirectory of it (the intended use), then it must follow
the <B>V</B> or <B>D</B> instruction that creates the parent
directory, and the <B>F</B>, <B>E</B>, or <B>X</B> instruction
that creates the file being linked to. Creating a file on the local
disk of the machine where the <B>uss</B> command runs is not recommended,
for the reasons detailed in <A HREF="#HDRWQ633">About Creating Local Disk Directories and Files</A>.
<P>Note that AFS allows hard links only between files that reside in the same
directory. This restriction is necessary to eliminate the confusion
that results from associating two potentially different ACLs (those of the two
directories) with the same file. Symbolic links are legal between two
files that reside in different directories and even in different
volumes. The ACL on the actual file applies to the link as well.
<P>You do not set the owner or mode bits on a link created with an
<B>L</B> or <B>S</B> instruction, as you do for directories or
files. The <B>uss</B> command interpreter automatically records the
UNIX UID of the <B>uss</B> command&#39;s issuer as the owner, and sets
the mode bits to <B>lrwxrwxrwx</B> (777).

<P><DT><B>ad
</B><DD>Is the shortest acceptable abbreviation of <B>add</B>.
<P><DT><B>-user
</B><DD>Names the user&#39;s Authentication Database and Protection Database
entries. Because it becomes the username (the name under which a user
logs in), it must obey the restrictions that many operating systems impose on
usernames (usually, to contain no more than eight lowercase letters).
Also avoid the following characters&#58; colon (<B>&#58;</B>),
semicolon (<B>;</B>), comma (<B>,</B>), at sign (<B>@</B>),
space, newline, and the period (<B>.</B>), which is conventionally
used only in special administrative names.
<P>This argument provides the value for the $USER variable in the template
file. For suggestions on standardizing usernames, see <A HREF="auagd007.htm#HDRWQ73">Choosing Usernames and Naming Other Account Components</A>.
<P><DT><B>-admin
</B><DD>Names an administrative account that has the <TT>ADMIN</TT> flag on its

prompt echoes it as <VAR>admin_user</VAR>. Enter the appropriate password
as <VAR>admin_password</VAR>.
<P><DT><B>-realname
</B><DD>Specifies the user&#39;s actual full name. If it contains spaces
or punctuation, surround it with double quotes. If you do not provide
it, it defaults to the username provided with the <B>-user</B>
argument.
<P>This argument provides the value for the $NAME variable in the template
file. For information about using this argument and variable as part of
an automated process for creating entries in a local password file such as
<B>/etc/passwd</B>, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ612">Creating a Common Source Password File</A>.
<P><DT><B>-pass
</B><DD>Specifies the user&#39;s initial password. Although the AFS
commands that handle passwords accept strings of virtually unlimited length,
it is best to use a password of eight characters or less, which is the maximum
length that many applications and utilities accept.
<P>Possible choices for initial passwords include the username, a string of
digits such as those from a Social Security number, or a standard string such
as <B>changeme</B>, which is the default if you do not provide this
argument. There is no corresponding variable in the template
file.
<P>Instruct users to change their passwords to a truly secret string as soon
as they authenticate with AFS for the first time. The <I>AFS User
Guide</I> explains how to use the <B>kpasswd</B> command to change an
AFS password.
<P><DT><B>-pwexpires
</B><DD>Sets the number of days after a user&#39;s password is changed that it
remains valid. Provide an integer from the range <B>1</B> through
<B>254</B> to specify the number of days until expiration, or the value
<B>0</B> to indicate that the password never expires (the default if you
do not provide this argument). When the password becomes invalid
(expires), the user is unable to authenticate, but has 30 more days in which
to issue the <B>kpasswd</B> command to change the password; after
that, only an administrator can change it.
<P>This argument provides the value for the $PWEXPIRES variable in the
template file.
<P><DT><B>-server
</B><DD>Names the file server machine on which to create the new user&#39;s home
volume. It is best to provide a fully qualified hostname (for example,
<B>fs1.abc.com</B>), but an abbreviated form is acceptable
provided that the cell&#39;s naming service is available to resolve it when
you issue the <B>uss add</B> command.
<P>This argument provides the value for the $SERVER variable in the template
file. To avoid having to type a fully qualified hostname on the command
line, combine the $SERVER variable with a constant (for example, the
cell&#39;s domain name) in the <VAR>server</VAR> field of the <B>V</B>
instruction in the template file. For an example, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ636">Creating a Volume with the V Instruction</A>.
<P><DT><B>-partition
</B><DD>Specifies the partition on which to create the user&#39;s home
volume; it must be on the file server machine named by the
<B>-server</B> argument. Identify the partition by its complete
name (for example, <B>/vicepa</B>), or use one of the abbreviations listed
in <A HREF="auagd023.htm#HDRWQ840">Rules for Using Abbreviations and Aliases</A>.
<P>This argument provides the value for the $PART variable in the template
file.
<P><DT><B>-mount
</B><DD>Specifies the pathname for the user&#39;s home directory in the
cell&#39;s read/write filespace. Partial pathnames are interpreted
relative to the current working directory.
<P>This argument provides the value for the $MTPT variable in the template
file, but only when it appears in the <B>V</B> instruction&#39;s
<VAR>mount_point</VAR> field. When the $MTPT variable appears in any
subsequent instructions, it takes its value from the <B>V</B>
instruction&#39;s <VAR>mount_point</VAR> field, rather than directly from this
argument. For more details, and for suggestions about how to use this
argument and the $MTPT variable, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ636">Creating a Volume with the V Instruction</A>.
<P><DT><B>-uid
</B><DD>Specifies a positive integer other than <B>0</B> (zero) to assign as
the user&#39;s AFS UID. It is best to omit this argument and allow the
Protection Server to assign an AFS UID that is one greater than the current
value of the <TT>max user id</TT> counter. (To display the counter,
use the <B>pts listmax</B> command as described in <A HREF="auagd019.htm#HDRWQ771">To display the AFS ID counters</A>.) 
<P>If you have a reason to use this argument (perhaps because the user already
has a UNIX UID), first use the <B>pts examine</B> command to verify that
there is no existing account with the desired AFS UID; if there is, the
account creation process terminates with an error.
<P>This argument provides the value for the $UID variable in the template
file.
<P><DT><B>-template
</B><DD>Specifies the pathname of the template file. If you omit this
argument, the command interpreter searches for a template file called
<B>uss.template</B> in each of the following directories in
turn&#58; 
<OL TYPE=a>
<P><LI>The current working directory
<P><LI><B>/afs/</B><VAR>cellname</VAR><B>/common/uss</B>, where

</OL>
<P>If you specify a filename other than <B>uss.template</B> but
without a pathname, the command interpreter searches for it in the indicated
directories. If you provide a full or partial pathname, the command
interpreter consults the specified file only; it interprets partial
pathnames relative to the current working directory.
<P>If the specified template file is empty (zero-length), the command creates
Protection and Authentication Database entries only.
<P>To learn how to construct a template file, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ617">Constructing a uss Template File</A>.
<P><DT><B>-var
</B><DD>Specifies values for each of the number variables $1 through $9 that can
appear in the template file. You can use the number variables to assign
values to variables in the <B>uss</B> template file that are not part of
the standard set.
<P>For each instance of this argument, provide two parts in the indicated
order, separated by a space&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>The integer from the range <B>1</B> through <B>9</B> that matches
the variable in the template file. Do not precede it with a dollar

<P>To learn about suggested uses for the number variables, see the description
of the <B>V</B> instruction&#39;s <VAR>quota</VAR> field in <A HREF="#HDRWQ636">Creating a Volume with the V Instruction</A>.
<P><DT><B>-dryrun

and for which there are definitions in <B>D</B>, <B>E</B>,
<B>F</B>, <B>L</B>, or <B>S</B> instructions in the template file
named by the <B>-template</B> argument. If you omit this flag, the

overwrite all such elements.

<P>For a complete description of the acceptable values in each field, see the
<B>uss Bulk Input File</B> reference page in the <I>AFS Administration
Reference</I>, or the description of the corresponding arguments to the
<B>uss add</B> command, in <A HREF="#HDRWQ654">To create an AFS account with the uss add command</A>. Following are some basic notes&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>Begin the line with the string <B>add</B> only, not <B>uss
add</B>.
<P><LI>Only the first argument, <VAR>username</VAR>, is required. It
corresponds to the <B>-user</B> argument to the <B>uss add</B>
command.
<P><LI>Do not surround the <VAR>full_name</VAR> value with double quotes, even
though you must use them around the value for the <B>-realname</B>
argument to the <B>uss add</B> command.
<P><LI>If you want to omit a value for an argument, indicate an empty field by
using two colons with nothing between them. Leaving a field empty is
acceptable if the corresponding command line argument is optional or if the
corresponding variable does not appear in the template file. For every
field that precedes the last one to which you assign an actual value, you must
either provide a value or indicate an empty field. It is acceptable,
but not necessary, to indicate empty fields after the last one in which you
assign a value.
<P><LI>After the last field, end the line with either a colon and newline
character (<B>&lt;Return></B>), or a newline alone.
<P><LI>The final nine fields are for assigning values to the number variables ($1
through $9), with the fields listed in increasing numerical order.
Specify the value only, not the variable number.
</UL>
<P><B>Deleting a User Account with the delete Instruction</B>
<P>Each <B>delete</B> instruction deletes a single user account, and so is
basically the equivalent of issuing one <B>uss delete</B> command.
There is no limit to the number of <B>delete</B> instructions in the bulk
input file.
<P>Like all instructions in the bulk input file, each <B>delete</B>
instruction must be a single line in the file (have a newline character only
at its end), even though it can cover multiple lines on a display
screen. The curly braces (<B>{  }</B>) indicate two mutually
exclusive choices.
<PRE>   <B>delete</B> <VAR>username</VAR><B>&#58;</B><VAR>mount_point_path</VAR>[&#58;{ <B>savevolume</B> | <B>delvolume</B> }][<B>&#58;</B>]
</PRE>
<P>For a complete description of the acceptable values in each field, see the
<B>uss Bulk Input File</B> reference page in the <I>AFS Administration
Reference</I> or the description of the corresponding arguments to the
<B>uss delete</B> command, in <A HREF="#HDRWQ658">To delete an AFS account</A>. Following are some basic notes&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>Begin the line with the string <B>delete</B> only, not <B>uss
delete</B>.
<P><LI>The first two arguments, <VAR>username</VAR> and <VAR>mount_point_path</VAR>,
are required. They correspond to the <B>-user</B> and
<B>-mountpoint</B> arguments to the <B>uss delete</B> command.
<P><LI>The third field, which is optional, controls whether the user&#39;s home
volume is removed from the file server where it resides, along with the
corresponding VLDB entry. There are three possible values&#58; 
<UL>
<P><LI>No value treats the volume and VLDB entry according to the prevailing
default, which is established by a preceding <B>savevolume</B> or
<B>delvolume</B> instruction in the template file. See the
following discussion of those instructions to learn how the default is
set.
<P><LI>The string <B>savevolume</B> preserves the volume and VLDB entry,
overriding the default.
<P><LI>The string <B>delvolume</B> removes the volume and VLDB entry,
overriding the default.
</UL>
<P><LI>After the last field, end the line with either a colon and newline
character (<B>&lt;Return></B>), or a newline alone.
</UL>
<P><B>Running a Command or Script with the exec Instruction</B>
<P>The <B>exec</B> instruction runs the indicated AFS command, compiled
program, or UNIX shell script or command. The command processor assumes
the AFS and local identities of the issuer of the <B>uss bulk</B> command,
who must have the privileges required to run the command.
<P>The instruction&#39;s syntax is as follows&#58;
<PRE>   <B>exec</B> <VAR>command</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>It is not necessary to surround the <VAR>command</VAR> string with double
quotes (" ") or other delimiters.
<P><B>Setting the Default Treatment of Volumes with the delvolume and
savevolume Instructions</B>
<P>The <B>savevolume</B> and <B>delvolume</B> instructions set the
default treatment of volumes referenced by the <B>delete</B> instructions
that follow them in the bulk input file. Their syntax is as
follows&#58;
<PRE>   <B>savevolume</B>
   <B>delvolume</B>
</PRE>
<P>Both instructions are optional and take no arguments. If neither
appears in the bulk input file, then by default all volumes and VLDB entries
referenced by <B>delete</B> instructions are removed. If the
<B>savevolume</B> instruction appears in the file, it prevents the removal
of the volume and VLDB entry referenced by all subsequent <B>delete</B>
instructions in the file. The <B>delvolume</B> instruction
explicitly establishes the default (which is deletion) for subsequent
<B>delete</B> instructions.
<P>The effect of either instruction lasts until the end of the bulk input
file, or until its opposite appears. To override the prevailing default
for a particular <B>delete</B> instruction, put the <B>savevolume</B>
or <B>delvolume</B> string in the instruction&#39;s third field.
(You can also use multiple instances of the <B>savevolume</B> and
<B>delvolume</B> instructions to toggle back and forth between default
preservation and deletion of volumes.)
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_570" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_570">Example Bulk Input File Instructions</A></H3>
<P>To create an authentication-only account, use an <B>add</B>
instruction like the following example, which includes only the first
(<VAR>username</VAR>) argument. The user&#39;s real name is set to match
the username (<B>anderson</B>) and her initial password is set to the
string <B>changeme</B>.
<PRE>   add anderson 
</PRE>
<P>The following example also creates an authentication-only account, but sets
nondefault values for the real name and initial password.
<PRE>   add smith&#58;John Smith&#58;js_pswd
</PRE>
<P>The next two example <B>add</B> instructions require that the
administrator of the ABC Corporation cell (<B>abc.com</B>) has
written a <B>uss</B> template file with the following <B>V</B>
instruction in it&#58;
<PRE>   V user.$USER $SERVER.abc.com /vicep$PART 10000 /afs/.abc.com/usr/$3/$USER \
       $UID $USER all
</PRE>
<P>To create accounts for users named John Smith from the Marketing Department
and Pat Jones from the Finance Department, the appropriate <B>add</B>
instructions in the bulk input file are as follows&#58;
<PRE>   add smith&#58;John Smith&#58;&#58;&#58;fs1&#58;a&#58;&#58;&#58;&#58;&#58;marketing
   add jones&#58;Pat Jones&#58;&#58;&#58;fs3&#58;c&#58;&#58;&#58;&#58;&#58;finance
</PRE>
<P>The new account for Smith consists of Protection and Authentication
Database entries called <B>smith</B>. His initial password is the
default string <B>changeme</B>, and the Protection Server generates his
AFS UID. His home volume, called <B>user.smith</B>, has a
10,000 KB quota, resides on partition <B>/vicepa</B> of file server
machine <B>fs1.abc.com</B>, and is mounted at
<B>/afs/.abc.com/usr/marketing/smith</B>. The final
<B>$UID $USER all</B> part of the <B>V</B> instruction gives him
ownership of his home directory and all permissions on its ACL. The
account for <B>jones</B> is similar, except that it resides on partition
<B>/vicepc</B> of file server machine <B>fs3.abc.com</B>
and is mounted at
<B>/afs/.abc.com/usr/finance/jones</B>.
<P>Notice that the fields corresponding to <VAR>mount_point</VAR>, <VAR>uid</VAR>,
<VAR>var1</VAR>, and <VAR>var2</VAR> are empty (between the values <TT>a</TT>
and <TT>marketing</TT> on the first example line) because the corresponding
variables do not appear in the <B>V</B> instruction in the template
file. The <VAR>initial_passwd</VAR> and <VAR>password_expires</VAR> fields
are also empty.
<P>If you wish, you can specify values or empty fields for all nine number
variables in an <B>add</B> instruction. In that case, the bulk
input file instructions are as follows&#58;
<PRE>   add smith&#58;John Smith&#58;&#58;&#58;fs1&#58;a&#58;&#58;&#58;&#58;&#58;marketing&#58;&#58;&#58;&#58;&#58;&#58;
   add jones&#58;Pat Jones&#58;&#58;&#58;fs3&#58;c&#58;&#58;&#58;&#58;&#58;finance&#58;&#58;&#58;&#58;&#58;&#58;
</PRE>
<P>The following example is a section of a bulk input file with a number of
<B>delete</B> instructions and a <B>savevolume</B> instruction.
Because the first three instructions appear before the <B>savevolume</B>
instruction and their third field is blank, the corresponding volumes and VLDB
entries are removed. The <B>delete</B> instruction for user
<B>terry</B> follows the <B>savevolume</B> instruction, so her volume
is not removed, but the volume for user <B>johnson</B> is, because the
<B>delvolume</B> string in the third field of the <B>delete</B>
instruction overrides the current default.
<PRE>   delete smith&#58;/afs/abc.com/usr/smith
   delete pat&#58;/afs/abc.com/usr/pat
   delete rogers&#58;/afs/abc.com/usr/rogers
   savevolume
   delete terry&#58;/afs/abc.com/usr/terry
   delete johnson&#58;/afs/abc.com/usr/johnson&#58;delvolume
</PRE>
<P>The following example <B>exec</B> instruction is useful as a separator
between a set of <B>add</B> instructions and a set of <B>delete</B>
instructions. It generates a message on the standard output stream that
informs you of the <B>uss bulk</B> command&#39;s progress.

point, it resides in the <B>root.cell</B> volume mounted at the

step, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ612">Creating a Common Source Password File</A>. 
<P>Even if you do not use the automated method, set the user&#39;s UNIX UID
to match the AFS UID assigned automatically by the Protection Server or
assigned with the <B>-uid</B> argument. The new user&#39;s AFS UID
appears in the trace produced by the <B>uss add</B> output or you can use

<P><LI>If you are deleting accounts, delete the user&#39;s entry from the local
password file (<B>/etc/passwd</B> or equivalent) of each client
machine. If you use the AFS <B>package</B> utility, it is
sufficient to remove the entry from the common source version of the
file. If you intend to reactivate the user&#39;s account in the
future, it is simpler to comment out the entry or place an asterisk (*) in the
password field.
