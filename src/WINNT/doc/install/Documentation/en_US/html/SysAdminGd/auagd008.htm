<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ117" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_101">Local Disk Files on a Server Machine</A></H2>
<P>Several types of files must reside in the subdirectories of
the <B>/usr/afs</B> directory on an AFS server machine&#39;s local
disk. They include binaries, configuration files, the administrative
database files (on database server machines), log files, and volume header
files.
<P><B>Note for Windows users&#58;</B> Some files described in this
document possibly do not exist on machines that run a Windows operating
system. Also, Windows uses a backslash
(&nbsp;<B>\</B>&nbsp;) rather than a forward slash
(&nbsp;<B>/</B>&nbsp;) to separate the elements in a
pathname.

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ118" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_102">Binaries in the /usr/afs/bin Directory</A></H3>
<P>The <B>/usr/afs/bin</B> directory stores the AFS server
process and command suite binaries appropriate for the machine&#39;s system
(CPU and operating system) type. If a process has both a server portion
and a client portion (as with the Update Server) or if it has separate
components (as with the <B>fs</B> process), each component resides in a
separate file.
<P>To ensure predictable system performance, all file server machines must run
the same AFS build version of a given process. To maintain consistency
easily, use the Update Server process to distribute binaries from a
<I>binary distribution machine</I> of each system type, as described
further in <A HREF="#HDRWQ127">Binary Distribution Machines</A>.
<P>It is best to keep the binaries for all processes in the
<B>/usr/afs/bin</B> directory, even if you do not run the process actively
on the machine. It simplifies the process of reconfiguring machines
(for example, adding database server functionality to an existing file server
machine). Similarly, it is best to keep the command suite binaries in
the directory, even if you do not often issue commands while working on the
server machine. It enables you to issue commands during recovery from
server and machine outages.
<P>The following lists the binary files in the <B>/usr/afs/bin</B>
directory that are directly related to the AFS server processes or command
suites. Other binaries (for example, for the <B>klog</B> command)
sometimes appear in this directory on a particular file server machine&#39;s
disk or in an AFS distribution.

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ119" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_103">Common Configuration Files in the /usr/afs/etc Directory</A></H3>
<P>The directory <B>/usr/afs/etc</B> on every file server
machine&#39;s local disk contains configuration files in ASCII and
machine-independent binary format. For predictable AFS performance
throughout a cell, all server machines must have the same version of each
configuration file&#58;
<UL>
<A NAME="IDX5936"></A>
<P><LI>Cells that run the United States edition of AFS conventionally use the
Update Server to distribute a common version of each file from the cell&#39;s
system control machine to other server machines (for more on the system
control machine, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ128">The System Control Machine</A>). Run the Update Server&#39;s server portion on the
system control machine, and the client portion on all other server
machines. Update the files on the system control machine only, except
as directed by instructions for dealing with emergencies.
<P><LI>Cells that run the international edition of AFS must not use the Update
Server to distribute the contents of the <B>/usr/afs/etc</B>
directory. Due to United States government regulations, the data
encryption routines that AFS uses to protect the files in this directory as
they cross the network are not available to the Update Server in the
international edition of AFS. You must instead update the files on each
server machine individually, taking extra care to issue exactly the same
<B>bos</B> command for each machine. The necessary data encryption
routines are available to the <B>bos</B> commands, so information is safe
as it crosses the network from the machine where the <B>bos</B> command is
issued to the server machines.
</UL>
<P>Never directly edit any of the files in the <B>/usr/afs/etc</B>
directory, except as directed by instructions for dealing with
emergencies. In normal circumstances, use the appropriate
<B>bos</B> commands to change the files. The following list
includes pointers to instructions.
<P>The files in this directory include&#58;
<DL>
<A NAME="IDX5937"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5938"></A>
<P><DT><B>CellServDB
</B><DD>An ASCII file that names the cell&#39;s database server machines, which
run the Authentication, Backup, Protection, and VL Server processes.
You create the initial version of this file by issuing the <B>bos
setcellname</B> command while installing your cell&#39;s first server
machine. It is very important to update this file when you change the
identity of your cell&#39;s database server machines. 
<P>The server <B>CellServDB</B> file is not the same as the
<B>CellServDB</B> file stored in the <B>/usr/vice/etc</B> directory on
client machines. The client version lists the database server machines
for every AFS cell that you choose to make accessible from the client
machine. The server <B>CellServDB</B> file lists only the local
cell&#39;s database server machines, because server processes never contact
processes in other cells.

<A NAME="IDX5939"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5940"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5941"></A>
<P><DT><B>KeyFile
</B><DD>A machine-independent, binary-format file that lists the server encryption
keys the AFS server processes use to encrypt and decrypt tickets. The
information in this file is the basis for secure communication in the cell,
and so is extremely sensitive. The file is specially protected so that
only privileged users can read or change it. 
<P>For instructions on maintaining this file, see <A HREF="auagd014.htm#HDRWQ477">Managing Server Encryption Keys</A>.
<A NAME="IDX5942"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5943"></A>
<P><DT><B>ThisCell
</B><DD>An ASCII file that consists of a single line defining the complete
Internet domain-style name of the cell (such as
<TT>abc.com</TT>). You create this file with the <B>bos
setcellname</B> command during the installation of your cell&#39;s first
file server machine, as instructed in the <I>AFS Quick
Beginnings</I>.
<P>Note that changing this file is only one step in changing your cell&#39;s

<A NAME="IDX5944"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5945"></A>

<P>The directory <B>/usr/afs/local</B> contains
configuration files that are different for each file server machine in a
cell. Thus, they are not updated automatically from a central source
like the files in <B>/usr/afs/bin</B> and <B>/usr/afs/etc</B>
directories. The most important file is the <B>BosConfig</B>
file; it defines which server processes are to run on that
machine.
<P>As with the common configuration files in <B>/usr/afs/etc</B>, you must
not edit these files directly. Use commands from the <B>bos</B>
command suite where appropriate; some files never need to be
altered.
<P>The files in this directory include the following&#58;
<DL>
<A NAME="IDX5950"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5951"></A>
<P><DT><B>BosConfig
</B><DD>This file lists the server processes to run on the server machine, by
defining which processes the BOS Server monitors and what it does if the
process fails. It also defines the times at which the BOS Server
automatically restarts processes for maintenance purposes.
<P>As you create server processes during a file server machine&#39;s
installation, their entries are defined in this file automatically. The
<I>AFS Quick Beginnings</I> outlines the <B>bos</B> commands to
use. For a more complete description of the file, and instructions for
controlling process status by editing the file with commands from the

<A NAME="IDX5952"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5953"></A>
<P><DT><B>NetInfo
</B><DD>This optional ASCII file lists one or more of the network interface
addresses on the server machine. If it exists when the File Server
initializes, the File Server uses it as the basis for the list of interfaces
that it registers in its Volume Location Database (VLDB) server entry.
See <A HREF="#HDRWQ172">Managing Server IP Addresses and VLDB Server Entries</A>.
<A NAME="IDX5954"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5955"></A>
<P><DT><B>NetRestrict
</B><DD>This optional ASCII file lists one or more network interface
addresses. If it exists when the File Server initializes, the File
Server removes the specified addresses from the list of interfaces that it
registers in its VLDB server entry. See <A HREF="#HDRWQ172">Managing Server IP Addresses and VLDB Server Entries</A>.
<A NAME="IDX5956"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5957"></A>
<P><DT><B>NoAuth
</B><DD>This zero-length file instructs all AFS server processes running on the
machine not to perform authorization checking. Thus, they perform any
action for any user, even <B>anonymous</B>. This very insecure
state is useful only in rare instances, mainly during the installation of the
machine.
<P>The file is created automatically when you start the initial
<B>bosserver</B> process with the <B>-noauth</B> flag, or issue the
<B>bos setauth</B> command to turn off authentication requirements.
When you use the <B>bos setauth</B> command to turn on authentication, the
BOS Server removes this file. For more information, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ157">Managing Authentication and Authorization Requirements</A>.
<A NAME="IDX5958"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5959"></A>
<P><DT><B>SALVAGE.fs
</B><DD>This zero-length file controls how the BOS Server handles a crash of the
File Server component of the <B>fs</B> process. The BOS Server
creates this file each time it starts or restarts the <B>fs</B>
process. If the file is present when the File Server crashes, then the
BOS Server runs the Salvager before restarting the File Server and Volume
Server again. When the File Server exits normally, the BOS Server
removes the file so that the Salvager does not run.
<P>Do not create or remove this file yourself; the BOS Server does so
automatically. If necessary, you can salvage a volume or partition by
using the <B>bos salvage</B> command; see <A HREF="auagd010.htm#HDRWQ317">Salvaging Volumes</A>.
<A NAME="IDX5960"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5961"></A>
<P><DT><B>salvage.lock
</B><DD>This file guarantees that only one Salvager process runs on a file server
machine at a time (the single process can fork multiple subprocesses to
salvage multiple partitions in parallel). As the Salvager initiates
(when invoked by the BOS Server or by issue of the <B>bos salvage</B>
command), it creates this zero-length file and issues the <B>flock</B>
system call on it. It removes the file when it completes the salvage
operation. Because the Salvager must lock the file in order to run,
only one Salvager can run at a time.

<A NAME="IDX5963"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5964"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5965"></A>
<P><DT><B>sysid
</B><DD>This file records the network interface addresses that the File Server
(<B>fileserver</B> process) registers in its VLDB server entry.
When the Cache Manager requests volume location information, the Volume
Location (VL) Server provides all of the interfaces registered for each server
machine that houses the volume. This enables the Cache Manager to make
use of multiple addresses when accessing AFS data stored on a multihomed file
server machine. For further information, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ172">Managing Server IP Addresses and VLDB Server Entries</A>.

<P>The <B>/usr/afs/logs</B> directory contains log files
from various server processes. The files detail interesting events that
occur during normal operations. For instance, the Volume Server can
record volume moves in the <B>VolserLog</B> file. Events are
recorded at completion, so the server processes do not use these files to
reconstruct failed operations unlike the ones in the <B>/usr/afs/db</B>

<P>The information in log files can be very useful as you evaluate process
failures and other problems. For instance, if you receive a timeout
message when you try to access a volume, checking the <B>FileLog</B> file
possibly provides an explanation, showing that the File Server was unable to
attach the volume. To examine a log file remotely, use the <B>bos

being monitored by the BOS Server crashes. The BOS Server attempts to
add an extension to the standard <B>core</B> name to indicate which
process generated the core file (for example, naming a core file generated by
the Protection Server <B>core.ptserver</B>). The BOS Server
cannot always assign the correct extension if two processes fail at about the

<P>In cells that have more than one server machine, not all
server machines have to perform exactly the same functions. The are
four possible <I>roles</I> a machine can assume, determined by which
server processes it is running. A machine can assume more than one role
by running all of the relevant processes. The following list summarizes
the four roles, which are described more completely in subsequent
sections.
<UL>
<P><LI>A <I>simple file server machine</I> runs only the processes that store
and deliver AFS files to client machines. You can run as many simple
file server machines as you need to satisfy your cell&#39;s performance and
disk space requirements.
<P><LI>A <I>database server machine</I> runs the four database server
processes that maintain AFS&#39;s replicated administrative databases&#58;
the Authentication, Backup, Protection, and Volume Location (VL) Server
processes.
<P><LI>A <I>binary distribution machine</I> distributes the AFS server
binaries for its system type to all other server machines of that system
type.
<P><LI>The single <I>system control machine</I> distributes common server
configuration files to all other server machines in the cell, in a cell that
runs the United States edition of AFS (cells that use the international
edition of AFS must not use the system control machine for this
purpose). The machine conventionally also serves as the time
synchronization source for the cell, adjusting its clock according to a time
source outside the cell.
</UL>
<P>If a cell has a single server machine, it assumes the simple file server
and database server roles. The instructions in the <I>AFS Quick
Beginnings</I> also have you configure it as the system control machine and
binary distribution machine for its system type, but it does not actually
perform those functions until you install another server machine.
<P>It is best to keep the binaries for all of the AFS server processes in the
<B>/usr/afs/bin</B> directory, even if not all processes are
running. You can then change which roles a machine assumes simply by
starting or stopping the processes that define the role.

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ125" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_109">Simple File Server Machines</A></H3>
<P>A <I>simple file server machine</I> runs only the server
processes that store and deliver AFS files to client machines, monitor process
status, and pick up binaries and configuration files from the cell&#39;s
binary distribution and system control machines.
<P>In general, only cells with more than three server machines need to run
simple file server machines. In cells with three or fewer machines, all
of them are usually database server machines (to benefit from replicating the
administrative databases); see <A HREF="#HDRWQ126">Database Server Machines</A>.

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ126" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_110">Database Server Machines</A></H3>
<P>A <I>database server machine</I> runs the four processes
that maintain the AFS replicated administrative databases&#58; the
Authentication Server, Backup Server, Protection Server, and Volume Location
(VL) Server, which maintain the Authentication Database, Backup Database,
Protection Database, and Volume Location Database (VLDB), respectively.
To review the functions of these server processes and their databases, see <A HREF="auagd006.htm#HDRWQ17">AFS Server Processes and the Cache Manager</A>.
<P>If a cell has more than one server machine, it is best to run more than one
database server machine, but more than three are rarely necessary.
Replicating the databases in this way yields the same benefits as replicating
volumes&#58; increased availability and reliability of information.
If one database server machine or process goes down, the information in the
database is still available from others. The load of requests for
database information is spread across multiple machines, preventing any one
from becoming overloaded.
<P>Unlike replicated volumes, however, replicated databases do change
frequently. Consistent system performance demands that all copies of
the database always be identical, so it is not possible to record changes in
only some of them. To synchronize the copies of a database, the
database server processes use AFS&#39;s distributed database technology,
Ubik. See <A HREF="#HDRWQ136">Replicating the AFS Administrative Databases</A>.
<P>It is critical that the AFS server processes on every server machine in a
cell know which machines are the database server machines. The database
server processes in particular must maintain constant contact with their peers
in order to coordinate the copies of the database. The other server
processes often need information from the databases. Every file server
machine keeps a list of its cell&#39;s database server machines in its local
<B>/usr/afs/etc/CellServDB</B> file. Cells that use the States
edition of AFS can use the system control machine to distribute this file (see
<A HREF="#HDRWQ128">The System Control Machine</A>).
<P>The following processes define a database server machine&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>The Authentication Server (<B>kaserver</B> process)
<P><LI>The Backup Server (<B>buserver</B> process)
<P><LI>The Protection Server (<B>ptserver</B> process)
<P><LI>The VL Server (<B>vlserver</B> process)
</UL>
<P>Database server machines can also run the processes that define a simple
file server machine, as listed in <A HREF="#HDRWQ125">Simple File Server Machines</A>. One database server machine can act as the
cell&#39;s system control machine, and any database server machine can serve
as the binary distribution machine for its system type; see <A HREF="#HDRWQ128">The System Control Machine</A> and <A HREF="#HDRWQ127">Binary Distribution Machines</A>.

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ127" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_111">Binary Distribution Machines</A></H3>
<P>A <I>binary distribution machine</I> stores and
distributes the binary files for the AFS processes and command suites to all
other server machines of its system type. Each file server machine
keeps its own copy of AFS server process binaries on its local disk, by
convention in the <B>/usr/afs/bin</B> directory. For consistent
system performance, however, all server machines must run the same version
(build level) of a process. For instructions for checking a
binary&#39;s build level, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ151">Displaying A Binary File&#39;s Build Level</A>. The easiest way to keep the binaries
consistent is to have a binary distribution machine of each system type
distribute them to its system-type peers.
<P>The process that defines a binary distribution machine is the server
portion of the Update Server (<B>upserver</B> process). The client
portion of the Update Server (<B>upclientbin</B> process) runs on the
other server machines of that system type and references the binary
distribution machine.
<P>Binary distribution machines usually also run the processes that define a
simple file server machine, as listed in <A HREF="#HDRWQ125">Simple File Server Machines</A>. One binary distribution machine can act as the
cell&#39;s system control machine, and any binary distribution machine can
serve as a database server machine; see <A HREF="#HDRWQ128">The System Control Machine</A> and <A HREF="#HDRWQ126">Database Server Machines</A>.

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ128" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_112">The System Control Machine</A></H3>
<P>In cells that run the United States edition of AFS, the
<I>system control machine</I> stores and distributes system configuration
files shared by all of the server machines in the cell. Each file
server machine keeps its own copy of the configuration files on its local
disk, by convention in the <B>/usr/afs/etc</B> directory. For
consistent system performance, however, all server machines must use the same
files. The easiest way to keep the files consistent is to have the
system control machine distribute them. You make changes only to the
copy stored on the system control machine, as directed by the instructions in
this document. The United States edition of AFS is available to cells
in the United States and Canada and to selected institutions in other
countries, as determined by United States government regulations.
<P>Cells that run the international version of AFS do not use the system
control machine to distribute system configuration files. Some of the
files contain information that is too sensitive to cross the network
unencrypted, and United States government regulations forbid the export of the
necessary encryption routines in the form that the Update Server uses.
You must instead update the configuration files on each file server machine
individually. The <B>bos</B> commands that you use to update the
files encrypt the information using an exportable form of the encryption
routines.
<P>For a list of the configuration files stored in the <B>/usr/afs/etc</B>
directory, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ119">Common Configuration Files in the /usr/afs/etc Directory</A>.
<P>The <I>AFS Quick Beginnings</I> configures a cell&#39;s first server
machine as the system control machine. If you wish, you can reassign
the role to a different machine that you install later, but you must then
change the client portion of the Update Server (<B>upclientetc</B>)
process running on all other server machines to refer to the new system
control machine.
<P>The following processes define the system control machine&#58;
<UL>
<A NAME="IDX6034"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6035"></A>
<P><LI>The server portion of the Update Server (<B>upserver</B>) process, in
cells using the United States edition of AFS. The client portion of the
Update Server (<B>upclientetc</B> process) runs on the other server
machines and references the system control machine.
<P><LI>The NTP coordinator (<B>runntp</B> process) which points to a time
source outside the cell, if the cell uses NTPD to synchronize its
clocks. The <B>runntp</B> process on other machines reference the
system control machine as their main time source.
</UL>
<P>The system control machine can also run the processes that define a simple
file server machine, as listed in <A HREF="#HDRWQ125">Simple File Server Machines</A>. It can also server as a database server machine, and
by convention acts as the binary distribution machine for its system
type. A single <B>upserver</B> process can distribute both

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ136" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_120">Replicating the AFS Administrative Databases</A></H3>
<P>There are several benefits to replicating the AFS
administrative databases (the Authentication, Backup, Protection, and Volume
Location Databases), as discussed in <A HREF="auagd007.htm#HDRWQ67">Replicating the AFS Administrative Databases</A>. For correct cell functioning, the copies of each
database must be identical at all times. To keep the databases
synchronized, AFS uses library of utilities called <I>Ubik</I>.
Each database server process runs an associated lightweight Ubik process, and
client-side programs call Ubik&#39;s client-side subroutines when they submit
requests to read and change the databases.
<P>Ubik is designed to work with minimal administrator intervention, but there
are several configuration requirements, as detailed in <A HREF="#HDRWQ137">Configuring the Cell for Proper Ubik Operation</A>. The following brief overview of Ubik&#39;s
operation is helpful for understanding the requirements. For more
details, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ138">How Ubik Operates Automatically</A>.
<P>Ubik is designed to distribute changes made in an AFS administrative
database to all copies as quickly as possible. Only one copy of the
database, the <I>synchronization site</I>, accepts change requests from
clients; the lightweight Ubik process running there is the <I>Ubik
coordinator</I>. To maintain maximum availability, there is a
separate Ubik coordinator for each database, and the synchronization site for
each of the four databases can be on a different machine. The
synchronization site for a database can also move from machine to machine in
response to process, machine, or network outages.
<P>The other copies of a database, and the Ubik processes that maintain them,
are termed <I>secondary</I>. The secondary sites do not accept
database changes directly from client-side programs, but only from the
synchronization site.
<P>After the Ubik coordinator records a change in its copy of a database, it
immediately sends the change to the secondary sites. During the brief
distribution period, clients cannot access any of the copies of the database,
even for reading. If the coordinator cannot reach a majority of the
secondary sites, it halts the distribution and informs the client that the
attempted change failed.
<P>To avoid distribution failures, the Ubik processes maintain constant
contact by exchanging time-stamped messages. As long as a majority of
the secondary sites respond to the coordinator&#39;s messages, there is a
<I>quorum</I> of sites that are synchronized with the coordinator.
If a process, machine, or network outage breaks the quorum, the Ubik processes
attempt to elect a new coordinator in order to establish a new quorum among
the highest possible number of sites. See <A HREF="#HDRWQ140">A Flexible Coordinator Boosts Availability</A>.

<P><H4><A NAME="HDRWQ137">Configuring the Cell for Proper Ubik Operation</A></H4>
<P>This section describes how to configure your cell to
maintain proper Ubik operation.
<UL>
<P><LI>Run all four database server processes--Authentication Server, Backup
Server, Protection Server, and VL Server--on all database server
machines. 
<P>Both the client and server portions of Ubik expect that all the database
server machines listed in the <B>CellServDB</B> file are running all of
the database server processes. There is no mechanism for indicating
that only some database server processes are running on a machine.
<P><LI>Maintain correct information in the <B>/usr/afs/etc/CellServDB</B>
file at all times. 
<P>Ubik consults the <B>/usr/afs/etc/CellServDB</B> file to determine the
sites with which to establish and maintain a quorum. Incorrect
information can result in unsynchronized databases or election of a
coordinator in each of several subgroups of machines, because the Ubik
processes on various machines do not agree on which machines need to
participate in the quorum.
<P>If you run the United States version of AFS and use the Update Server, it
is simplest to maintain the <B>/usr/afs/etc/CellServDB</B> file on the
system control machine, which distributes its copy to all other server
machines. The <I>AFS Quick Beginnings</I> explains how to configure
the Update Server. If you run the international version of AFS, you
must update the file on each machine individually.
<P>The only reason to alter the file is when configuring or decommissioning a
database server machine. Use the appropriate <B>bos</B> commands
rather than editing the file by hand. For instructions, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ152">Maintaining the Server CellServDB File</A>. The instructions in <A HREF="auagd009.htm#HDRWQ176">Monitoring and Controlling Server Processes</A> for stopping and starting processes remind
you to alter the <B>CellServDB</B> file when appropriate, as do the
instructions in the <I>AFS Quick Beginnings</I> for installing or
decommissioning a database server machine.
<P>(Client processes and the server processes that do not maintain databases
also rely on correct information in the <B>CellServDB</B> file for proper
operation, but their use of the information does not affect Ubik&#39;s
operation. See <A HREF="#HDRWQ152">Maintaining the Server CellServDB File</A> and <A HREF="auagd015.htm#HDRWQ552">Maintaining Knowledge of Database Server Machines</A>.)
<A NAME="IDX6066"></A>
<P><LI>Keep the clocks synchronized on all machines in the cell, especially the
database server machines. 
<P>In the conventional configuration specified in the <I>AFS Quick
Beginnings</I>, you run the <B>runntp</B> process to supervise the local
Network Time Protocol Daemon (NTPD) on every AFS server machine. The
NTPD on the system control machine synchronizes its clock with a reliable
source outside the cell and broadcasts the time to the NTPDs on the other
server machines. You can choose to run a different time synchronization
protocol if you wish.
<P>Keeping clocks synchronized is important because the Ubik processes at a
database&#39;s sites timestamp the messages which they exchange to maintain
constant contact. Timestamping the messages is necessary because in a
networked environment it is not safe to assume that a message reaches its
destination instantly. Ubik compares the timestamp on an incoming
message with the current time. If the difference is too great, it is
possible that an outage is preventing reliable communication between the Ubik
sites, which can possibly result in unsynchronized databases. Ubik
considers the message invalid, which can prompt it to attempt election of a
different coordinator.
<P>Electing a new coordinator is appropriate if a timestamped message is
expired due to actual interruption of communication, but not if a message
appears expired only because the sender and recipient do not share the same
time. For detailed examples of how unsynchronized clocks can
destabilize Ubik operation, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ139">How Ubik Uses Timestamped Messages</A>.

<A NAME="IDX6069"></A>
<P><H4><A NAME="HDRWQ138">How Ubik Operates Automatically</A></H4>
<P>The following Ubik features help keep its maintenance
requirements to a minimum&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>Ubik&#39;s server and client portions operate automatically. 
<P>Each database server process runs a lightweight process to call on the
server portion of the Ubik library. It is common to refer to this
lightweight process itself as Ubik. Because it is lightweight, the Ubik
process does not appear in process listings such as those generated by the
UNIX <B>ps</B> command. Client-side programs that need to read and
change the databases directly call the subroutines in the Ubik library&#39;s
client portion, rather than running a separate lightweight process.
Examples of such programs are the <B>klog</B> command and the commands in
the <B>pts</B> suite.
<P><LI>Ubik tracks database version numbers. 
<P>As the coordinator records a change to a database, it increments the
database&#39;s version number. The version number makes it easy for
the coordinator to determine if a site has the most recent version or
not. The version number speeds the return to normal functioning after
election of a new coordinator or when communication is restored after an
outage, because it makes it easy to determine which site has the most current
database and which need to be updated.
<P><LI>Ubik&#39;s use of timestamped messages guarantees that database copies
are always synchronized during normal operation. 
<P>Replicating a database to increase data availability is pointless if all
copies of the database are not the same. Inconsistent performance can
result if clients receive different information depending on which copy of the
database they access. As previously noted, Ubik sites constantly track
the status of their peers by exchanging timestamped messages. For a
detailed description, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ139">How Ubik Uses Timestamped Messages</A>.
<P><LI>The ability to move the coordinator maximizes database
availability. 
<P>Suppose, for example, that in a cell with three database server machines a
network partition separates the two secondary sites from the
coordinator. The coordinator retires because it is no longer in contact
with a majority of the sites listed in the <B>CellServDB</B> file.
The two sites on the other side of the partition can elect a new coordinator
among themselves, and it can then accept database changes from clients.
If the coordinator cannot move in this way, the database has to be read-only
until the network partition is repaired. For a detailed description of
Ubik&#39;s election procedure, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ140">A Flexible Coordinator Boosts Availability</A>.
</UL>
<A NAME="IDX6070"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6071"></A>
<P><H5><A NAME="HDRWQ139">How Ubik Uses Timestamped Messages</A></H5>
<P>Ubik synchronizes the copies of a database by maintaining
constant contact between the synchronization site and the secondary
sites. The Ubik coordinator frequently sends a time-stamped
<I>guarantee</I> message to each of the secondary sites. When the
secondary site receives the message, it concludes that it is in contact with
the coordinator. It considers its copy of the database to be valid
until time <I>T</I>, which is usually 60 seconds from the time the
coordinator sent the message. In response, the secondary site returns a
<I>vote</I> message that acknowledges the coordinator as valid until a
certain time X, which is usually 120 seconds in the future.
<P>The coordinator sends guarantee messages more frequently than every
<I>T</I> seconds, so that the expiration periods overlap. There is
no danger of expiration unless a network partition or other outage actually
interrupts communication. If the guarantee expires, the secondary
site&#39;s copy of the database it not necessarily current.
Nonetheless, the database server continues to service client requests.
It is considered better for overall cell functioning that a secondary site
remains accessible even if the information it is distributing is possibly out
of date. Most of the AFS administrative databases do not change that
frequently, in any case, and making a database inaccessible causes a timeout
for clients that happen to access that copy.
<P>As previously mentioned, Ubik&#39;s use of timestamped messages makes it
vital to synchronize the clocks on database server machines. There are
two ways that skewed clocks can interrupt normal Ubik functioning, depending
on which clock is ahead of the others.
<P>Suppose, for example, that the Ubik coordinator&#39;s clock is ahead of
the secondary sites&#58; the coordinator&#39;s clock says
9&#58;35&#58;30, but the secondary clocks say 9&#58;31&#58;30.
The secondary sites send votes messages that acknowledge the coordinator as
valid until 9&#58;33&#58;30. This is two minutes in the future
according to the secondary clocks, but is already in the past from the
coordinator&#39;s perspective. The coordinator concludes that it no
longer has enough support to remain coordinator and forces election of a new
coordinator. Election takes about three minutes, during which time no
copy of the database accepts changes.
<P>The opposite possibility is that a secondary site&#39;s clock
(14&#58;50&#58;00) is ahead of the coordinator&#39;s
(14&#58;46&#58;30). When the coordinator sends a guarantee message
good until 14&#58;47&#58;30), it has already expired according to the
secondary clock. Believing that it is out of contact with the
coordinator, the secondary site stops sending votes for the coordinator and
tries get itself elected as coordinator. This is appropriate if the
coordinator has actually failed, but is inappropriate when there is no actual
outage.
<P>The attempt of a single secondary site to get elected as the new
coordinator usually does not affect the performance of the other sites.
As long as their clocks agree with the coordinator&#39;s, they ignore the
other secondary site&#39;s request for votes and continue voting for the
current coordinator. However, if enough of the secondary sites&#39;s
clocks get ahead of the coordinator&#39;s, they can force election of a new
coordinator even though the current one is actually working fine.

<A NAME="IDX6080"></A>
<P><H5><A NAME="HDRWQ140">A Flexible Coordinator Boosts Availability</A></H5>
<P>Ubik uses timestamped messages to determine when coordinator
election is necessary, just as it does to keep the database copies
synchronized. As long as the coordinator receives vote messages from a
majority of the sites (it implicitly votes for itself), it is appropriate for
it to continue as coordinator because it is successfully distributing database
changes. A majority is defined as more than 50% of all database sites
when there are an odd number of sites; with an even number of sites, the
site with the lowest Internet address has an extra vote for breaking ties as
necessary.If the coordinator is not receiving sufficient votes, it
retires and the Ubik sites elect a new coordinator. This does not
happen spontaneously, but only when the coordinator really fails or stops
receiving a majority of the votes. The secondary sites have a built-in
bias to continue voting for an existing coordinator, which prevents undue
elections.
<P>The election of the new coordinator is by majority vote. The Ubik
subprocesses have a bias to vote for the site with the lowest Internet
address, which helps it gather the necessary majority quicker than if all the
sites were competing to receive votes themselves. During the election
(which normally lasts less than three minutes), clients can read information
from the database, but cannot make any changes.
<P>Ubik&#39;s election procedure makes it possible for each database server
process&#39;s coordinator to be on a different machine. For example,
if the Ubik coordinators for all four processes start out on machine A and the
Protection Server on machine A fails for some reason, then a different site
(say machine B) must be elected as the new Protection Database Ubik
coordinator. Machine B remains the coordinator for the Protection
Database even after the Protection Server on machine A is working
again. The failure of the Protection Server has no effect on the
Authentication, Backup, or VL Servers, so their coordinators remain on machine
A.
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ141" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_125">Backing Up and Restoring the Administrative Databases</A></H3>
<P>The AFS administrative databases store information that is
critical for AFS operation in your cell. If a database becomes
corrupted due to a hardware failure or other problem on a database server
machine, it likely to be difficult and time-consuming to recreate all of the
information from scratch. To protect yourself against loss of data,
back up the administrative databases to a permanent media, such as tape, on a
regular basis. The recommended method is to use a standard local disk
backup utility such as the UNIX <B>tar</B> command.
<P>When deciding how often to back up a database, consider the amount of data
that you are willing to recreate by hand if it becomes necessary to restore
the database from a backup copy. In most cells, the databases differ
quite a bit in how often and how much they change. Changes to the
Authentication Database are probably the least frequent, and consist mostly of
changed user passwords. Protection Database and VLDB changes are
probably more frequent, as users add or delete groups and change group
memberships, and as you and other administrators create or move
volumes. The number and frequency of changes is probably greatest in
the Backup Database, particularly if you perform backups every day.
<P>The ease with which you can recapture lost changes also differs for the
different databases&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>If regular users make a large proportion of the changes to the
Authentication Database and Protection Database in your cell, then recovering
them possibly requires a large amount of detective work and interviewing of
users, assuming that they can even remember what changes they made at what
time.
<P><LI>Recovering lost changes to the VLDB is more straightforward, because you
can use the <B>vos syncserv</B> and <B>vos syncvldb</B> commands to
correct any discrepancies between the VLDB and the actual state of volumes on
server machines. Running these commands can be time-consuming,
however.
<P><LI>The configuration information in the Backup Database (Tape Coordinator
port offsets, volume sets and entries, the dump hierarchy, and so on) probably
does not change that often, in which case it is not that hard to recover a few
recent changes. In contrast, there are likely to be a large number of
new dump records resulting from dump operations. You can recover these
records by using the <B>-dbadd</B> argument to the <B>backup
scantape</B> command, reading in information from the backup tapes
themselves. This can take a long time and require numerous tape
changes, however, depending on how much data you back up in your cell and how
you append dumps. Furthermore, the <B>backup scantape</B> command
is subject to several restrictions. The most basic is that it halts if
it finds that an existing dump record in the database has the same dump ID
number as a dump on the tape it is scanning. If you want to continue
with the scanning operation, you must locate and remove the existing record
from the database. For further discussion, see the <B>backup
scantape</B> command&#39;s reference page in the <I>AFS Administration
Reference</I>.
</UL>
<P>These differences between the databases possibly suggest backing up the
database at different frequencies, ranging from every few days or weekly for
the Backup Database to every few weeks for the Authentication Database.
On the other hand, it is probably simpler from a logistical standpoint to back
them all up at the same time (and frequently), particularly if tape
consumption is not a major concern. Also, it is not generally necessary
to keep backup copies of the databases for a long time, so you can recycle the
tapes fairly frequently.

<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ144" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_128">Installing Server Process Software</A></H2>
<P>This section explains how to install new server process
binaries on file server machines, how to revert to a previous version if the
current version is not working properly, and how to install new disks to house
AFS volumes on a file server machine.
<P>The most frequent reason to replace a server process&#39;s binaries is to
upgrade AFS to a new version. In general, installation instructions
accompany the updated software, but this chapter provides an additional
reference.
<P>Each AFS server machine must store the server process binaries in a local
disk directory, called <B>/usr/afs/bin</B> by convention. For
predictable system performance, it is best that all server machines run the
same build level, or at least the same version, of the server software.
For instructions on checking AFS build level, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ151">Displaying A Binary File&#39;s Build Level</A>.
<P>The Update Server makes it easy to distribute a consistent version of
software to all server machines. You designate one server machine of
each system type as the <I>binary distribution machine</I> by running the
server portion of the Update Server (<B>upserver</B> process) on
it. All other server machines of that system type run the client
portion of the Update Server (<B>upclientbin</B> process) to retrieve
updated software from the binary distribution machine. The <I>AFS
Quick Beginnings</I> explains how to install the appropriate
processes. For more on binary distribution machines, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ127">Binary Distribution Machines</A>.
<P>When you use the Update Server, you install new binaries on binary
distribution machines only. If you install binaries directly on a
machine that is running the <B>upclientbin</B> process, they are
overwritten the next time the process compares the contents of the local
<B>/usr/afs/bin</B> directory to the contents on the system control
machine, by default within five minutes.
<P>The following instructions explain how to use the appropriate commands from
the <B>bos</B> suite to install and uninstall server binaries.

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ145" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_129">Installing New Binaries</A></H3>
<P>An AFS server process does not automatically switch to a new
process binary file as soon as it is installed in the <B>/usr/afs/bin</B>
directory. The process continues to use the previous version of the
binary file until it (the process) next restarts. By default, the BOS
Server restarts processes for which there are new binary files every day at
5&#58;00 a.m., as specified in the
<B>/usr/afs/local/BosConfig</B> file. To display or change this
<I>binary restart time</I>, use the <B>bos getrestart</B> and <B>bos
setrestart</B> commands, as described in <A HREF="auagd009.htm#HDRWQ225">Setting the BOS Server&#39;s Restart Times</A>.
<P>You can force the server machine to start using new server process binaries
immediately by issuing the <B>bos restart</B> command as described in the
following instructions.
<P>You do not need to restart processes when you install new command suite
binaries. The new binary is invoked automatically the next time a
command from the suite is issued.

<A NAME="IDX6099"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6100"></A>
<P>When you use the <B>bos install</B> command, the BOS Server
automatically saves the current version of a binary file by adding a
<B>.BAK</B> extension to its name. It renames the current
<B>.BAK</B> version, if any, to the <B>.OLD</B> version,
if there is no <B>.OLD</B> version already. If there is a
current <B>.OLD</B> version, the current <B>.BAK</B>
version must be at least seven days old to replace it.
<P>It is best to store AFS binaries in the <B>/usr/afs/bin</B> directory,
because that is the only directory the BOS Server automatically checks for new
binaries. You can, however, use the <B>bos install</B>
command&#39;s <B>-dir</B> argument to install non-AFS binaries into other
directories on a server machine&#39;s local disk. See the
command&#39;s reference page in the <I>AFS Administration Reference</I>

<P>As detailed in <A HREF="#HDRWQ136">Replicating the AFS Administrative Databases</A>, the database server processes use the Ubik utility to
synchronize the information in the databases they maintain. The Ubik
coordinator at the synchronization site for each database maintains the single
read/write copy of the database and distributes changes to the secondary sites
as necessary. It must maintain contact with a majority of the secondary
sites to remain the coordinator, and consults the <B>CellServDB</B> file
to learn how many peers it has and on which machines they are running.
<P>If the coordinator loses contact with the majority of its peers, they all
cooperate to elect a new coordinator by majority vote. During the
election, all of the Ubik processes consult the <B>CellServDB</B> file to
learn where to send their votes, and what number constitutes a
majority.
<P><LI>The non-database server processes must know which machines are running the
database server processes in order to retrieve information from the
databases. For example, the first time that a user accesses an AFS
file, the File Server that houses it contacts the Protection Server to obtain
a list of the user&#39;s group memberships (the list is called a current
protection subgroup, or CPS). The File Server uses the CPS as it
determines if the access control list (ACL) protecting the file grants the
required permissions to the user (for more details, see <A HREF="auagd019.htm#HDRWQ744">About the Protection Database</A>).
</UL>
<A NAME="IDX6140"></A>
<P>The consequences of missing or incorrect information in the
<B>CellServDB</B> file are as follows&#58; 
<UL>
<P><LI>If the file does not list a machine, then it is effectively not a database
server machine even if the database server processes are running. The
Ubik coordinator does not send it database updates or include it in the count
that establishes a majority. It does not participate in Ubik elections,
and so refuses to distribute database information to any client machines that
happen to contact it (which they can do if their
<B>/usr/vice/etc/CellServDB</B> file lists it). Users of the client
machine must wait for a timeout before they can contact a correctly
functioning database server machine.
<P><LI>If the file lists a machine that is not running the database server
processes, the consequences can be serious. The Ubik coordinator cannot
send it database updates, but includes it in the count that establishes a
majority. If valid secondary sites go down and stop sending their votes
to the coordinator, it can wrongly appear that the coordinator no longer has
the majority it needs. The resulting election of a new coordinator
causes a service outage during which information from the database becomes
unavailable. Furthermore, the lack of a vote from the incorrectly
listed site can disturb the election, if it makes the other sites believe that
a majority of sites are not voting for the new coordinator.
<P>A more minor consequence is that non-database server processes attempt to
contact the database server processes on the machine. They experience a
timeout delay because the processes are not running.

the file whenever you change your cell&#39;s database server machines.
A server machine that is also a client needs to have both files, and you need

your cell&#39;s server machines every time you add or remove a database
server machine. The <I>AFS Quick Beginnings</I> provides complete
instructions for installing or removing a database server machine and for
updating the <B>CellServDB</B> file in that context. This section
explains how to distribute the file to your server machines and how to make
other cells aware of the changes if you participate in the AFS global name
space.
<P>If you use the United States edition of AFS, use the Update Server to
distribute the central copy of the server <B>CellServDB</B> file stored on
the cell&#39;s system control machine. If you use the international
edition of AFS, instead change the file on each server machine
individually. For further discussion of the system control machine and
why international cells must not use it for files in the
<B>/usr/afs/etc</B> directory, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ128">The System Control Machine</A>. For instructions on configuring
the Update Server when using the United States version of AFS, see the
<I>AFS Quick Beginnings</I>.
<P>To avoid formatting errors that can cause errors, always use the <B>bos
addhost</B> and <B>bos removehost</B> commands, rather than editing the
file directly. You must also restart the database server processes
running on the machine, to initiate a coordinator election among the new set
of database server machines. This step is included in the instructions
that appear in <A HREF="#HDRWQ155">To add a database server machine to the CellServDB file</A> and <A HREF="#HDRWQ156">To remove a database server machine from the CellServDB file</A>. For instructions on displaying the
contents of the file, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ154">To display a cell&#39;s database server machines</A>.
<P>If you make your cell accessible to foreign users as part of the AFS global
name space, you also need to inform other cells when you change your
cell&#39;s database server machines. The AFS Support group maintains a
<B>CellServDB</B> file that lists all cells that participate in the AFS
global name space, and can change your cell&#39;s entry at your
request. For further details, see <A HREF="auagd007.htm#HDRWQ38">Making Your Cell Visible to Others</A>.
<P>Another way to advertise your cell&#39;s database server machines is to
maintain a copy of the file at the conventional location in your AFS

<P>This section describes how the AFS server processes
guarantee that only properly authorized users perform privileged commands, by
checking authorization checking and mutually authenticating with their
clients. It explains how you can control authorization checking
requirements on a per-machine or per-cell basis, and how to bypass mutual
authentication when issuing commands.

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ158" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_145">Authentication versus Authorization</A></H3>
<P>Many AFS commands are <I>privileged</I> in that the AFS
server process invoked by the command performs it only for a properly
authorized user. The server process performs the following two tests to
determine if someone is properly authorized&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>In the <I>authentication</I> test, the server process mutually
authenticates with the command interpreter, Cache Manager, or other client
process that is acting on behalf of a user or application. The goal of
this test is to determine who is issuing the command. The server
process verifies that the issuer really is who he or she claims to be, by
examining the server ticket and other components of the issuer&#39;s
token. (Secondarily, it allows the client process to verify that the
server process is genuine.) If the issuer has no token or otherwise
fails the test, the server process assigns him or her the identity
<B>anonymous</B>, a completely unprivileged user. For a more
complete description of mutual authentication, see <A HREF="auagd007.htm#HDRWQ90">A More Detailed Look at Mutual Authentication</A>. 
<P>Many individual commands enable you to bypass the authentication test by
assuming the <B>anonymous</B> identity without even attempting to mutually
authenticate. Note, however, that this is futile if the command is
privileged and the server process is still performing the authorization test,
because in that case the process refuses to execute privileged commands for
the <B>anonymous</B> user.
<P><LI>In the <I>authorization</I> test, the server process determines if the
issuer is authorized to use the command by consulting a list of privileged
users. The goal of this test is to determine what the issuer is allowed
to do. Different server processes consult different lists of users, as
described in <A HREF="auagd021.htm#HDRWQ796">Managing Administrative Privilege</A>. The server process refuses to execute any privileged
command for an unauthorized issuer. If a command has no privilege
requirements, the server process skips this step and executes and
immediately.
<TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><B>Note:</B></TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">Never place the <B>anonymous</B> user or the

<P>You can use the <B>bos setauth</B> command to control whether the
server processes on a server machine check for authorization. Other
server machines are not affected. Keep in mind that turning off
authorization checking is a grave security risk, because the server processes
on that machine perform any action for any user.

<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ159" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_146">Controlling Authorization Checking on a Server Machine</A></H3>
<P>Disabling authorization checking is a serious breach of
security because it means that the AFS server processes on a file server
machine performs any action for any user, even the <B>anonymous</B>
user.
<P>The only time it is common to disable authorization checking is when
installing a new file server machine (see the <I>AFS Quick
Beginnings</I>). It is necessary then because it is not possible to
configure all of the necessary security mechanisms before performing other
actions that normally make use of them. For greatest security, work at
the console of the machine you are installing and enable authorization
checking as soon as possible.
<P>During normal operation, the only reason to disable authorization checking
is if an error occurs with the server encryption keys, leaving the servers
unable to authenticate users properly. For instructions on handling
key-related emergencies, see <A HREF="auagd014.htm#HDRWQ495">Handling Server Encryption Key Emergencies</A>.
<P>You control authorization checking on each file server machine
separately; turning it on or off on one machine does not affect the
others. Because client machines generally choose a server process at
random, it is hard to predict what authorization checking conditions prevail
for a given command unless you make the requirement the same on all
machines. To turn authorization checking on or off for the entire cell,
you must repeat the appropriate command on every file server machine.
<P>The server processes constantly monitor the directory
<B>/usr/afs/local</B> on their local disks to determine if they need to
check for authorization. If the file called <B>NoAuth</B> appears
in that directory, then the servers do not check for authorization.
When it is not present (the usual case), they perform authorization
checking.
<P>Control the presence of the <B>NoAuth</B> file through the BOS
Server. When you disable authorization checking with the <B>bos
setauth</B> command (or, during installation, by putting the
<B>-noauth</B> flag on the command that starts up the BOS Server), the BOS
Server creates the zero-length <B>NoAuth</B> file. When you
reenable authorization checking, the BOS Server removes the file.

<P>AFS makes it very easy to add storage space to your cell,
just by adding disks to existing file server machines. This section
explains how to install or remove a disk used to store AFS volumes.
(Another way to add storage space is to install additional server machines, as
instructed in the <I>AFS Quick Beginnings</I>.)
<P>Both adding and removing a disk cause at least a brief file system outage,
because you must restart the <B>fs</B> process to have it recognize the
new set of server partitions. Some operating systems require that you
shut the machine off before adding or removing a disk, in which case you must
shut down all of the AFS server processes first. Otherwise, the
AFS-related aspects of adding or removing a disk are not complicated, so the
duration of the outage depends mostly on how long it takes to install or
remove the disk itself.
<P>The following instructions for installing a new disk completely prepare it
to house AFS volumes. You can then use the <B>vos create</B>
command to create new volumes, or the <B>vos move</B> command to move
existing ones from other partitions. For instructions, see <A HREF="auagd010.htm#HDRWQ270">Creating Read/write Volumes</A> and <A HREF="auagd010.htm#HDRWQ311">Moving Volumes</A>. The instructions for removing a
disk are basically the reverse of the installation instructions, but include
extra steps that protect against data loss.
<P>A server machines can house 256 AFS server partitions, each one mounted at
a directory with a name of the form <B>/vicep</B><I>index</I>, where
<I>index</I> is one or two lowercase letters. By convention, the
first partition on a machine is mounted at <B>/vicepa</B>, the second at
<B>/vicepb</B>, and so on to the twenty-sixth at
<B>/vicepz</B>. Additional partitions are mounted at
<B>/vicepaa</B> through <B>/vicepaz</B> and so on up to
<B>/vicepiv</B>. Using the letters consecutively is not required,
but is simpler.
<P>Mount each <B>/vicep</B> directory directly under the local file
system&#39;s root directory ( <B>/</B> ), not as a subdirectory of any
other directory; for example, <B>/usr/vicepa</B> is not an acceptable
location. You must also map the directory to the partition&#39;s
device name in the file server machine&#39;s file systems registry file
(<B>/etc/fstab</B> or equivalent).
<P>These instructions assume that the machine&#39;s AFS initialization file
includes the following command to restart the BOS Server after each
reboot. The BOS Server starts the other AFS server processes listed in
the local <B>/usr/afs/local/BosConfig</B> file. For information on

<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ172" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_155">Managing Server IP Addresses and VLDB Server Entries</A></H2>
<P>The AFS support for multihomed file server machines is
largely automatic. The File Server process records the IP addresses of
its file server machine&#39;s network interfaces in the local
<B>/usr/afs/local/sysid</B> file and also registers them in a <I>server
entry</I> in the Volume Location Database (VLDB). The
<B>sysid</B> file and server entry are identified by the same unique
number, which creates an association between them.
<P>When the Cache Manager requests volume location information, the Volume
Location (VL) Server provides all of the interfaces registered for each server
machine that houses the volume. This enables the Cache Manager to make
use of multiple addresses when accessing AFS data stored on a multihomed file
server machine.
<P>If you wish, you can control which interfaces the File Server registers in
its VLDB server entry by creating two files in the local
<B>/usr/afs/local</B> directory&#58; <B>NetInfo</B> and
<B>NetRestrict</B>. Each time the File Server restarts, it builds a
list of the local machine&#39;s interfaces by reading the <B>NetInfo</B>
file, if it exists. If you do not create the file, the File Server uses
the list of network interfaces configured with the operating system. It
then removes from the list any addresses that appear in the
<B>NetRestrict</B> file, if it exists. The File Server records the
resulting list in the <B>sysid</B> file and registers the interfaces in
the VLDB server entry that has the same unique identifier.
<P>On database server machines, the <B>NetInfo</B> and
<B>NetRestrict</B> files also determine which interfaces the Ubik database
synchronization library uses when communicating with the database server
processes running on other database server machines.
<P>There is a maximum number of IP addresses in each server entry, as
documented in the <I>AFS Release Notes</I>. If a multihomed file
server machine has more interfaces than the maximum, AFS simply ignores the
excess ones. It is probably appropriate for such machines to use the
<B>NetInfo</B> and <B>NetRestrict</B> files to control which
interfaces are registered.
<P>If for some reason the <B>sysid</B> file no longer exists, the File
Server creates a new one with a new unique identifier. When the File
Server registers the contents of the new file, the Volume Location (VL) Server
normally recognizes automatically that the new file corresponds to an existing
server entry, and overwrites the existing server entry with the new file
contents and identifier. However, it is best not to remove the
<B>sysid</B> file if that can be avoided.
<P>Similarly, it is important not to copy the <B>sysid</B> file from one
file server machine to another. If you commonly copy the contents of
the <B>/usr/afs</B> directory from an existing machine as part of
installing a new file server machine, be sure to remove the <B>sysid</B>
file from the <B>/usr/afs/local</B> directory on the new machine before
starting the File Server.
<P>There are certain cases where the VL Server cannot determine whether it is
appropriate to overwrite an existing server entry with a new <B>sysid</B>
file&#39;s contents and identifier. It then refuses to allow the File
Server to register the interfaces, which prevents the File Server from
starting. This can happen if, for example, a new <B>sysid</B> file
includes two interfaces that currently are registered by themselves in
separate server entries. In such cases, error messages in the
<B>/usr/afs/log/VLLog</B> file on the VL Server machine and in the
<B>/usr/afs/log/FileLog</B> file on the file server machine indicate that
you need to use the <B>vos changeaddr</B> command to resolve the
problem. Contact the AFS Product Support group for instructions and
assistance.
<P>Except in this type of rare error case, the only appropriate use of the
<B>vos changeaddr</B> command is to remove a VLDB server entry completely
when you remove a file server machine from service. The VLDB can
accommodate a maximum number of server entries, as specified in the <I>AFS
Release Notes</I>. Removing obsolete entries makes it possible to
allocate server entries for new file server machines as required. See
the instructions that follow.
<P>Do not use the <B>vos changeaddr</B> command to change the list of
interfaces registered in a VLDB server entry. To change a file server
machine&#39;s IP addresses and server entry, see the instructions that
follow.

<P>You can reboot a server machine either by typing the
appropriate commands at its console or by issuing the <B>bos exec</B>
command on a remote machine. Remote rebooting can be more convenient,
because you do not need to leave your present location, but you cannot track
the progress of the reboot as you can at the console. Remote rebooting
is possible because the server machine&#39;s operating system recognizes the
BOS Server, which executes the <B>bos exec</B> command, as the local
superuser <B>root</B>.
<P>Rebooting server machines is part of routine maintenance in some cells, and
some instructions in the AFS documentation include it as a step. It is
certainly not intended to be the standard method for recovering from
AFS-related problems, however, but only a last resort when the machine is
unresponsive and you have tried all other reasonable options.
<P>Rebooting causes a service outage. If the machine stores volumes,
they are all inaccessible until the reboot completes and the File Server
reattaches them. If the machine is a database server machine,
information from the databases can become unavailable during the reelection of
the synchronization site for each database server process; the VL Server
outage generally has the greatest impact, because the Cache Manager must be
able to access the VLDB to fetch AFS data.
<P>By convention, a server machine&#39;s AFS initialization file includes the
following command to restart the BOS Server after each reboot. It
starts the other AFS server processes listed in the local
