<P>The NFS/AFS Translator enables users on NFS client machines
to access the AFS filespace as if they are working on an AFS client machine,
which facilitates collaboration with other AFS users.
<P>An <I>NFS/AFS translator machine</I> (or simply <I>translator
machine</I>) is a machine configured as both an AFS client and an NFS
server&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>Its AFS client functionality enables it to access the AFS
filespace. The Cache Manager requests and caches files from AFS file
server machines, and can even maintain tokens for NFS users, if you have made
the configuration changes that enable NFS users to authenticate with
AFS.
<P><LI>Its NFS server functionality makes it possible for the translator machine
to export the AFS filespace to NFS client machines. When a user on an
NFS client machine mounts the translator machine&#39;s <B>/afs</B>
directory (or one of its subdirectories, if that feature is enabled), access
to AFS is immediate and transparent. The NFS client machine does not
need to run any AFS software.
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ824" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_669">Enabling Unauthenticated or Authenticated AFS Access</A></H3>
<P>By configuring the translation environment appropriately,
you can provide either unauthenticated or authenticated access to AFS from NFS
client machines. The sections of this chapter on configuring translator
machines, NFS client machines, and AFS user accounts explain how to configure
the translation environment appropriately.
<UL>
<P><LI>If you configure the environment for unauthenticated access, the AFS File
Server considers the NFS users to be the user <B>anonymous</B>.
They can access only those AFS files and directories for which the access
control list (ACL) extends the required permissions to the
<B>system&#58;anyuser</B> group. They can issue only those AFS
commands that do not require privilege, and then only if their NFS client
machine is a system type for which AFS binaries are available and accessible
by the <B>system&#58;anyuser</B> group. Such users presumably do
not have AFS accounts.
<P><LI>If you configure the environment for authenticated access, you must create
entries in the AFS Authentication and Protection Databases for the NFS
users. The authentication procedure they use depends on whether the NFS
client machine is a supported system type (one for which AFS binaries are
available)&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>If AFS binaries are available for the NFS client machine, NFS users can
issue the <B>klog</B> command on the NFS client machine. They can
access the filespace and issue AFS commands to the same extent as
authenticated users working on AFS client machines.
<P><LI>If AFS binaries are not available for the NFS client machine, NFS users
must establish a connection with the translator machine (using the
<B>telnet</B> utility, for example) and then issue the <B>klog</B> and
<B>knfs</B> commands on the translator machine to make its Cache Manager
use the tokens correctly while users work on the NFS client. They can
access the AFS filespace as authenticated users, but cannot issue AFS
commands. For instructions, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ837">Authenticating on Unsupported NFS Client Machines</A>.
</UL>
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ825" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_670">Setting the AFSSERVER and AFSCONF Environment Variables</A></H3>
<P>If you wish to enable your NFS users to issue AFS commands,
you must define the AFSSERVER and AFSCONF environment variables in their
command shell. This section explains the variables&#39; function and
outlines the various methods for setting them.
<P>Issuing AFS commands also requires that the NFS client machine is a
supported system type (one for which AFS binaries are available and
accessible). Users working on NFS client machines of unsupported system
types can access AFS as authenticated users, but they cannot issue AFS
commands. It is not necessary to define the AFSSERVER and AFSCONF
variables for such users. For instructions on using the <B>knfs</B>
command to obtain authenticated access on unsupported system types, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ837">Authenticating on Unsupported NFS Client Machines</A>.
<A NAME="IDX8164"></A>
<P><H4><A NAME="HDRWQ826">The AFSSERVER Variable</A></H4>
<P>The AFSSERVER variable designates the AFS client machine
that performs two functions for NFS clients&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>It acts as the NFS client&#39;s <I>remote executor</I> by executing
AFS-specific system calls on its behalf, such as those invoked by the
<B>klog</B> and <B>tokens</B> commands and by many commands in the AFS
suites.
<P><LI>Its stores the tokens that NFS users obtain when they authenticate with
AFS. This implies that the remote executor machine and the translator
machine must be the same if the user needs authenticated access to AFS.
</UL>
<P>The choice of remote executor most directly affects commands that display
or change Cache Manager configuration, such as the <B>fs
getcacheparms</B>, <B>fs getcellstatus</B>, and <B>fs setcell</B>
commands. When issued on an NFS client, these commands affect the Cache
Manager on the designated remote executor machine. (Note, however, that
several such commands require the issuer to be logged into the remote
executor&#39;s local file system as the local superuser
<B>root</B>. The ability of NFS client users to log in as
<B>root</B> is controlled by NFS, not by the NFS/AFS Translator, so
setting the remote executor properly does not necessarily enable users on the
NFS client to issue such commands.)
<P>The choice of remote executor is also relevant for AFS commands that do not
concern Cache Manager configuration but rather have the same result on every
machine, such as the <B>fs</B> commands that display or set ACLs and
volume quota. These commands take an AFS path as one of their
arguments. If the Cache Manager on the remote executor machine mounts
the AFS filespace at the <B>/afs</B> directory, as is conventional for AFS
clients, then the pathname specified on the NFS client must begin with the
string <B>/afs</B> for the Cache Manager to understand it. This
implies that the remote executor must be the NFS client&#39;s primary
translator machine (the one whose <B>/afs</B> directory is mounted at
<B>/afs</B> on the NFS client).
<A NAME="IDX8165"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8166"></A>
<P><H4><A NAME="Header_672">The AFSCONF Variable</A></H4>
<P>The AFSCONF environment variable names the directory that houses the
<B>ThisCell</B> and <B>CellServDB</B> files to use when running AFS
commands issued on the NFS client machine. As on an AFS client, these
files determine the default cell for command execution.
<P>For predictable performance, it is best that the files in the directory
named by the AFSCONF variable match those in the <B>/usr/vice/etc</B>
directory on the translator machine. If your cell has an AFS directory
that serves as the central update source for files in the
<B>/usr/vice/etc</B> directory, it is simplest to set the AFSCONF variable
to refer to it. In the conventional configuration, this directory is
called <B>/afs/</B><VAR>cellname</VAR><B>/common/etc</B>.
<P><H4><A NAME="Header_673">Setting Values for the Variables</A></H4>
<P>To learn the values of the AFSSERVER and AFSCONF variables, AFS command
interpreters consult the following three sources in sequence&#58;
<OL TYPE=1>
<P><LI>The current command shell&#39;s environment variable definitions
<P><LI>The <B>.AFSSERVER</B> or <B>.AFSCONF</B> file in the
issuer&#39;s home directory
<P><LI>The <B>/.AFSSERVER</B> or <B>/.AFSCONF</B> file in
the NFS client machine&#39;s root (<I>/</I>) directory. If the
client machine is diskless, its root directory can reside on an NFS server
machine.
</OL>
<P>(Actually, before consulting these sources, the NFS client looks for the
<B>CellServDB</B> and <B>ThisCell</B> files in its own
<B>/usr/vice/etc</B> directory. If the directory exists, the NFS
client does not use the value of the AFSCONF variable. However, the
<B>/usr/vice/etc</B> directory usually exists only on AFS clients, not NFS
clients.)
<P>As previously detailed, correct performance generally requires that the
remote executor machine be the NFS client&#39;s primary translator machine
(the one whose <B>/afs</B> directory is mounted at the <B>/afs</B>
directory on the NFS client). The requirement holds for all users
accessing AFS from the NFS client, so it is usually simplest to create the
<B>.AFSSERVER</B> file in the NFS client&#39;s root
directory. The main reason to create the file in a user&#39;s home
directory or to set the AFSSERVER environment variable in the current command
shell is that the user needs to switch to a different translator machine,
perhaps because the original one has become inaccessible.
<P>Similarly, it generally makes sense to create the
<B>.AFSCONF</B> file in the NFS client&#39;s root
directory. Creating it in the user&#39;s home directory or setting the
AFSCONF environment variable in the current command shell is useful mostly
when there is a reason to specify a different set of database server machines
for the cell, perhaps in a testing situation.
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ827" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_674">Delayed Writes for Files Saved on NFS Client Machines</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX8167"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8168"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8169"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8170"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8171"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8172"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8173"></A>
<P>When an application running on an AFS client machine issues the
<B>close</B> or <B>fsync</B> system call on a file, the Cache Manager
by default performs a synchronous write of the data to the File Server.
(For further discussion, see <A HREF="auagd007.htm#HDRWQ33">AFS Implements Save on Close</A> and <A HREF="auagd015.htm#HDRWQ564">Enabling Asynchronous Writes</A>.)
<P>To avoid degrading performance for the AFS users working on a translator
machine, AFS does not perform synchronous writes for applications running on
the translator machine&#39;s NFS clients. Instead, one of the Cache
Manager daemons (the <I>maintenance daemon</I>) checks every 60 seconds
for chunks in the cache that contain data saved on NFS clients, and writes
their contents to the File Server. This does not guarantee that data
saved on NFS clients is written to the File Server within 60 seconds, but only
that the maintenance daemon checks for and begins the write of data at that
interval.
<P>Furthermore, AFS always ignores the <B>fsync</B> system call as issued
on an NFS client. The call requires an immediate and possibly
time-consuming response from the File Server, which potentially causes delays
for other AFS clients of the File Server. NFS version 3 automatically
issues the <B>fsync</B> system call directly after the <B>close</B>
call, but the Cache Manager ignores it and handles the operation just like a
regular <B>close</B>.
<P>The delayed write mechanism means that there is usually a delay between the
time when an NFS application issues the <B>close</B> or <B>fsync</B>
system call on a file and the time when the changes are recorded at the File
Server, which is when they become visible to users working on other AFS client
machines (either directly or on its NFS clients). The delay is likely
to be longer than for files saved by users working directly on an AFS client
machine.
<P>The exact amount of delay is difficult to predict. The NFS protocol
itself allows a standard delay before saved data must be transferred from the
NFS client to the NFS server (the translator machine). The modified
data remains in the translator machine&#39;s AFS client cache until the
maintenance daemon&#39;s next scheduled check for such data, and it takes
additional time to transfer the data to the File Server. The
maintenance daemon uses a single thread, so there can be additional delay if
it takes more than 60 seconds to write out all of the modified NFS
data. That is, if the maintenance daemon is still writing data at the
time of the next scheduled check, it cannot notice any additional modified
data until the scheduled time after it completes the long write
operation.
<P>The Cache Manager&#39;s response to the <B>write</B> system call is
the same whether it is issued on an AFS client machine or on an NFS client of
a translator machine&#58; it records the modifications in the local AFS
client cache only.
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ828" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_675">Configuring NFS/AFS Translator Machines</A></H2>
<P>To act as an NFS/AFS translator machine, a machine must
configured as follows&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>It must be an AFS client. Many system types supported as AFS
clients can be translator machines. To learn about possible
restrictions in a specific release of AFS, see the <I>AFS Release
Notes</I>.
<P><LI>It must be an NFS server. The appropriate number of NFS server
daemons (<B>nfsd</B> and others) depends on the anticipated NFS client
load.
<P><LI>It must export the local directory on which the AFS filespace is mounted,
<B>/afs</B> by convention.
</UL>
<P>If users on a translator machine&#39;s NFS clients are to issue AFS
commands, the translator machine must also meet the requirements discussed in <A HREF="#HDRRMTSYS">Configuring the Translator Machine to Accept AFS Commands</A>.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_676" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_676">Loading NFS and AFS Kernel Extensions</A></H3>
<P>The AFS distribution for system types that can act as NFS/AFS
Translator machines usually includes two versions of the AFS kernel extensions
file, one for machines where the kernel supports NFS server functionality, and
one for machines not using NFS (the latter AFS kernel extensions file
generally has the string <B>nonfs</B> in its name). A translator
machine must use the NFS-enabled version of the AFS extensions file. On
some system types, you select the appropriate file by moving it to a certain
location, whereas on other system types you set a variable that results in
automatic selection of the correct file. See the instructions in the
<I>AFS Quick Beginnings</I> for incorporating AFS into the kernel on each
system type.
<P>On many system types, NFS is included in the kernel by default, so it is
not necessary to load NFS kernel extensions explicitly. On system types
where you must load NFS extensions, then in general you must load them before
loading the AFS kernel extensions. The <I>AFS Quick Beginnings</I>
describes how to incorporate the AFS initialization script into a
machine&#39;s startup sequence so that it is ordered correctly with respect
to the script that handles NFS.
<P>In addition, the AFS extensions must be loaded into the kernel before the
<B>afsd</B> command runs. The AFS initialization script included in
the AFS distribution correctly orders the loading and <B>afsd</B>
commands.
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRRMTSYS" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_677">Configuring the Translator Machine to Accept AFS Commands</A></H3>
<P>For users working on a translator machine&#39;s NFS
clients to issue AFS commands, the <B>-rmtsys</B> flag must be included on
the <B>afsd</B> command which initializes the translator machine&#39;s
Cache Manager. The flag starts an additional daemon (the <I>remote
executor daemon</I>), which executes AFS-specific system calls on behalf of
NFS clients. For a discussion of the implications of NFS users issuing
AFS commands, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ825">Setting the AFSSERVER and AFSCONF Environment Variables</A>.
<P>The instructions in the <I>AFS Quick Beginnings</I> for configuring the
Cache Manager explain how to add options such as the <B>-rmtsys</B> flag
to the <B>afsd</B> command in the AFS initialization script. On
many system types, it is simplest to list the flag on the line in the script
that defines the OPTIONS variable. The remote executor daemon does not
consume many resources, so it is simplest to add it to the <B>afsd</B>
command on every translator machine, even if not all users on the
machine&#39;s NFS clients issue AFS commands.
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ829" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_678">Controlling Optional Translator Features</A></H3>
<P>After an AFS client machine is configured as a translator
machine, it by default exports the AFS filespace to NFS clients. You
can disable and reenable translator functionality by using the <B>fs
exportafs</B> command&#39;s <B>-start</B> argument. The
command&#39;s other arguments control other aspects of translator
behavior.
<UL>
<P><LI>The <B>-convert</B> argument controls whether the second and third
(<B>group</B> and <B>other</B>) sets of UNIX mode bits on an AFS file
or directory being exported to NFS are set to match the first
(<B>owner</B>) mode bits. By default, the mode bits are set to
match.
<P>Unlike AFS, NFS uses all three sets of mode bits when determining whether a
user can read or write a file, even one stored in AFS. Some AFS files
possibly do not have any <B>group</B> and <B>other</B> mode bits
turned on, because AFS uses only the <B>owner</B> bits in combination with
the ACL on the file&#39;s directory. If only the <B>owner</B> mode
bits are set, NFS allows only the file&#39;s owner of the file to read or
write it. Setting the <B>-convert</B> argument to the value
<B>on</B> enables other users to access the file in the same manner as the
owner. Setting the value <B>off</B> preserves the mode bits set on
the file as stored in AFS.
<P><LI>The <B>-uidcheck</B> argument controls whether tokens can be assigned
to an NFS user whose local UID on the NFS client machine differs from the
local UID associated with the tokens on the translator machine. By
default, this is possible.
<P>If you turn on UID checking by setting the value <B>on</B>, then tokens
can be assigned only to an NFS user whose local UID matches the local UID of
the process on the translator machine that is assigning the tokens. One
consequence is that there is no point in including the <B>-id</B> argument
to the <B>knfs</B> command&#58; the only acceptable value is the local
UID of the command&#39;s issuer, which is the value used when the
<B>-id</B> argument is omitted. Requiring matching UIDs in this way
is effective only when users have the same local UID on the translator machine
as on NFS client machines. In that case, it guarantees that users
assign their tokens only to their own NFS sessions. For instructions,
see <A HREF="#HDRWQ837">Authenticating on Unsupported NFS Client Machines</A>.
<TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><B>Note:</B></TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">Turning on UID checking also prevents users on supported NFS clients from
using the <B>klog</B> command to authenticate on the NFS client
directly. They must authenticated and use the <B>knfs</B> command
on the translator machine instead. This is because after the
<B>klog</B> command interpreter obtains the token on the NFS client, it
passes it to the Cache Manager&#39;s remote executor daemon, which makes the
system call that stores the token in a credential structure on the translator
machine. The remote executor generally runs as the local superuser
<B>root</B>, so in most cases its local UID (normally zero) does not match
the local UID of the user who issued the <B>klog</B> command on the NFS
client machine. 
<P>On the other hand, although using the <B>knfs</B> command instead of
the <B>klog</B> command is possibly less convenient for users, it
eliminates a security exposure&#58; the <B>klog</B> command interpreter
passes the token across the network to the remote executor daemon in clear
text mode.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>If you disable UID checking by assigning the value <B>off</B> , the
issuer of the <B>knfs</B> command can assign tokens to a user who has a
different local UID on the NFS client machine, such as the local superuser
<B>root</B>. Indeed, more than one issuer of the <B>knfs</B>
command can assign tokens to the same user on the NFS client machine.
Each time a different user issues the <B>knfs</B> command with the same
value for the <B>-id</B> argument, that user&#39;s tokens overwrite the
existing ones. This can result in unpredictable access for the NFS
user.
<P><LI>The <B>-submounts</B> argument controls whether users on the NFS
client can mount AFS directories other than the top-level <B>/afs</B>
directory. By default, the translator does not permit these
submounts.
<P>Submounts can be useful in a couple of circumstances. If, for
example, NFS users need to access their own AFS home directories only, then
creating a submount to it eliminates the need for them to know or enter the
complete path. Similarly, you can use a submount to prevent users from
accessing parts of the filespace higher in the AFS hierarchy than the
submount.

<P>Any NFS client machine that meets the following requirements
can access files in AFS via the NFS/AFS Translator. It does not need to
be configured as an AFS client machine.
<UL>
<P><LI>It must NFS-mount a translator machine&#39;s <B>/afs</B> directory on
a local directory, which by convention is also called <B>/afs</B>.
The following instructions explain how to add the <B>mount</B> command to
the NFS client machine&#39;s <B>/etc/fstab</B> file or equivalent.
<P>
<P>The directory on which an NFS client mounts the translator&#39;s
machine&#39;s <B>/afs</B> directory can be called something other than
<B>/afs</B>. For instance, to make it easy to switch to another
translator machine if the original one becomes inaccessible, you can mount
more than one translator machine&#39;s <B>/afs</B> directory. Name
the mount <B>/afs</B> for the translator machine that you normally use,
and use a different name the mount to each alternate translator
machine.
<P>Mounting the AFS filespace on a directory other than <B>/afs</B>
introduces another requirement, however&#58; when issuing a command that
takes an AFS pathname argument, you must specify the full pathname, starting
with <B>/afs</B>, rather than a relative pathname. Suppose, for
example, that a translator machine&#39;s AFS filespace is mounted at
<B>/afs2</B> on an NFS client machine and you issue the following command
to display the ACL on the current working directory, which is in AFS&#58; 
<PRE>   % <B>fs listacl .</B>
</PRE> 
<P>The <B>fs</B> command interpreter on the NFS client must construct a
full pathname before passing the request to the Cache Manager on the
translator machine. The AFS filespace is mounted at <B>/afs2</B>,
so the full pathname starts with that string. However, the Cache
Manager on the translator cannot find a directory called <B>/afs2</B>,
because its mount of the AFS filespace is called <B>/afs</B>. The
command fails. To prevent the failure, provide the file&#39;s complete
pathname, starting with the string <B>/afs</B>.
<P><LI>It must run an appropriate number of NFS client <B>biod</B> daemons,
which improve performance by handling pre-reading and delayed writing.
Most NFS vendors recommend running four such daemons, and most NFS
initialization scripts start them automatically. Consult your NFS
documentation.
</UL>
<P>To enable users to issue AFS commands, the NFS client machine must also be
a supported system type (one for which AFS binaries are available) and able to
access the AFS command binaries. The <I>AFS Release Notes</I> list
the supported system types in each release.
<P>In addition, the AFSSERVER and AFSCONF environment variables must be set
appropriately, as discussed in <A HREF="#HDRWQ825">Setting the AFSSERVER and AFSCONF Environment Variables</A>.

<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ837" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_685">Authenticating on Unsupported NFS Client Machines</A></H2>
<P>The <B>knfs</B> command enables users to authenticate
with AFS when they are working on NFS clients of unsupported system types
(those for which AFS binaries are not available). This enables such
users to access the AFS file tree to the same extent as any other AFS
user. They cannot, however, issue AFS commands, which is possible only
on NFS client machines of supported system types.
<P>To authenticate on an unsupported system type, establish a connection to
the translator machine (using a facility such as <B>telnet</B>), and issue
the <B>klog</B> command to obtain tokens for all the cells you wish to
contact during the upcoming NFS session. Then issue the <B>knfs</B>
command, which stores the tokens in a credential structure associated with
your NFS session. The Cache Manager uses the tokens when performing AFS
access requests that originate from your NFS session.
<P>More specifically, the credential structure is identified by a process
authentication group (PAG) number associated with a particular local UID on a
specific NFS client machine. By default, the NFS UID recorded in the
credential structure is the same as your local UID on the translator
machine. You can include the <B>-id</B> argument to specify an
alternate NFS UID, unless the translator machine&#39;s administrator has used
the <B>fs exportafs</B> command&#39;s <B>-uidcheck</B> argument to
enable UID checking. In that case, the value of the <B>-id</B>
argument must match your local UID on the translator machine (so there is not
point to including the <B>-id</B> argument). Enforcing matching
UIDs prevents someone else from placing their tokens in your credential
structure, either accidentally or on purpose. However, it means that
your cell&#39;s administrators must set your local UID on the NFS client to
match your local UID on the translator machine. It also makes it
impossible to authenticate by issuing the <B>klog</B> command on supported
NFS clients, meaning that all NFS users must use the <B>knfs</B>
command. See <A HREF="#HDRWQ829">Controlling Optional Translator Features</A>.
<P>After issuing the <B>knfs</B> command, you can begin working on the NFS
client with authenticated access to AFS. When you are finished working,
it is a good policy to destroy your tokens by issuing the <B>knfs</B>
command on the translator machine again, this time with the <B>-unlog</B>
flag. This is simpler if you have left the connection to the translator
machine open, but you can always establish a new connection if you closed the
original one.
<P>If your NFS client machine is a supported system type and you wish to issue
AFS commands on it, include the <B>-sysname</B> argument to the
<B>knfs</B> command. The remote executor daemon on the translator
machine substitutes its value for the <B>@sys</B> variable in pathnames
when executing AFS commands that you issue on the NFS client machine.
If your PATH environment variable uses the <B>@sys</B> variable in the
pathnames for directories that house AFS binaries (as recommended), then
setting this argument enables the remote executor daemon to access the AFS
binaries appropriate for your NFS client machine even if its system type
differs from the translator machine&#39;s.
<P>If you do not issue the <B>knfs</B> command (or the <B>klog</B>
command on the NFS client machine itself, if it is a supported system type),
then you are not authenticated with AFS. For a description of
