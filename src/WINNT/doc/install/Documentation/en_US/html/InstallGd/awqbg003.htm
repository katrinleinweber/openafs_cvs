<P>AFS<SUP>(R)</SUP> is an enterprise file system that provides consistent
file access by way of a shared filespace. By joining the local file
systems of several File Server machines, AFS presents a single filespace
independent of machine boundaries. Files are stored on different
machines in the computer network but are accessible from all machines across
the enterprise.
<P>IBM AFS for Windows<SUP>(R)</SUP>, version 3.6 extends the full
capabilities of AFS to Microsoft<SUP>(R)</SUP> Windows operating
systems.

You can install the components of AFS for Windows in various combinations,
based on your Windows operating system. Refer to the <I>IBM AFS for
Windows Release Notes</I> for details on the specific software requirements
for each AFS for Windows component. Note that if you are installing the
AFS Server, you must also install the AFS Client, unless the AFS Client,
version 3.6 is already installed on the machine. Follow the
installation procedure described in <A HREF="#HDRHOWTOINSTALL">To Install AFS for Windows</A> regardless of the components you are installing.

You have the option of altering the AFS for Windows setup program to disable
all but the client component. Such a client-only setup program renders
users unable to install any components other than the AFS Client. To
perform a client-only installation, create the file <B>setup.co</B>
in the same directory as the other installation files; the setup program
then only allows the AFS Client to be installed. Note that the contents
of the <B>setup.co</B> file are irrelevent. Follow the
installation procedure described in <A HREF="#HDRHOWTOINSTALL">To Install AFS for Windows</A> regardless of the type of installation you are
performing.

On a Windows NT machine, it is <I>not</I> necessary to uninstall the
components of AFS for Windows for the purpose of upgrading the software;
you can install this release of AFS for Windows on your system
<I>without</I> removing or unconfiguring your existing software. To
upgrade AFS for Windows, follow the installation procedure described in <A HREF="#HDRHOWTOINSTALL">To Install AFS for Windows</A>. During the installation process, the
previous-version AFS component is upgraded and the AFS configuration
information is preserved.
<P>On a Windows 95 or Windows 98 machine, you must uninstall the
previously-installed AFS Light component, as described in <A HREF="#HDRTOUNINSTALL">To Uninstall AFS for Windows</A>, before upgrading AFS Light.
<P>Note that the AFS for Windows installation tool does <I>not</I> allow a
user to install AFS components that have different version numbers. If
you have more than one AFS for Windows component installed on your machine,
you cannot update one component without updating all of the other components
as well.
