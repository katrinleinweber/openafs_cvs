<P>This command does not use the syntax conventions of the AFS command
suites. Provide the command name and all option names in full.
<P><STRONG>Description</STRONG>
<P>The <B>afsd</B> command initializes the Cache Manager on an AFS client
machine by transferring AFS-related configuration information into kernel
memory and starting several daemons. More specifically, the
<B>afsd</B> command performs the following actions&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>Sets a field in kernel memory that defines the machine&#39;s cell
membership. Some Cache Manager-internal operations and system calls
consult this field to learn which cell to execute in. (The AFS command
interpreters refer to the <B>/usr/vice/etc/ThisCell</B> file
instead.) This information is transferred into the kernel from the
<B>/usr/vice/etc/ThisCell</B> file and cannot be changed until the
<B>afsd</B> program runs again.
<P><LI>Places in kernel memory the names and Internet addresses of the database
server machines in the local cell and (optionally) foreign cells. The
appearance of a cell&#39;s database server machines in this list enables the
Cache Manager to contact them and to access files in the cell. Omission
of a cell from this list, or incorrect information about its database server
machines, prevents the Cache Manager from accessing files in it.
<P>The list of database server machines is transferred into the kernel from
the <B>/usr/vice/etc/CellServDB</B> file. After initialization, use
the <B>fs newcell</B> command to change the kernel-resident list without
having to reboot.
<P><LI>Mounts the root of the AFS filespace on a directory on the machine&#39;s
local disk, according to either the first field in the
<B>/usr/vice/etc/cacheinfo</B> file (the default) or the <B>afsd</B>
command&#39;s <B>-mountdir</B> argument. The conventional value is
<B>/afs</B>.
<P><LI>Determines which volume to mount at the root of the AFS file tree.
The default is the volume <B>root.afs</B>; use the
<B>-rootvol</B> argument to override it. Although the base
(read/write) form of the volume name is the appropriate value, the Cache
Manager has a bias for accessing the read-only version of the volume (by
convention, <B>root.afs.readonly</B>) if it is
available.
<P><LI>Configures the cache on disk (the default) or in machine memory if the
<B>-memcache</B> argument is provided. In the latter case, the
<B>afsd</B> program allocates space in machine memory for caching, and the
Cache Manager uses no disk space for caching even if the machine has a
disk.
<P><LI>Defines the name of the local disk directory devoted to caching, when the
<B>-memcache</B> argument is not used. If necessary, the
<B>afsd</B> program creates the directory (its parent directory must
already exist). It does not remove the directory that formerly served
this function, if one exists.
<P>The second field in the <B>/usr/vice/etc/cacheinfo</B> file is the
source for this name, and the standard value is the <B>/usr/vice/cache</B>
directory. Use the <B>-cachedir</B> argument to override the value
in the <B>cacheinfo</B> file.
<P><LI>Sets the size of the cache. The default source for the value is the
third field in the <B>/usr/vice/etc/cacheinfo</B> file, which specifies a
number of kilobytes.
<P>For a memory cache, the following arguments to the <B>afsd</B> command
override the value in the <B>cacheinfo</B> file&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>The <B>-blocks</B> argument, to specify a different number of kilobyte
blocks.
<P><LI>The <B>-dcache</B> and <B>-chunksize</B> arguments together, to
set both the number of dcache entries and the chunk size (see below for
definition of these parameters). In this case, the <B>afsd</B>
program derives cache size by multiplying the two values. Using this
combination is not recommended, as it requires the issuer to perform the
calculation beforehand to determine the resulting cache size.
<P><LI>The <B>-dcache</B> argument by itself. In this case, the
<B>afsd</B> program derives cache size by multiplying the value specified
by the <B>-dcache</B> argument by the default memory cache chunk size of
eight kilobytes. Using this argument is not recommended, as it requires
the issuer to perform the calculation beforehand to determine the resulting
cache size.
</UL>
<P>For satisfactory memory cache performance, the specified value must leave
enough memory free to accommodate all other processes and commands that can
run on the machine. If the value exceeds the amount of memory
available, the <B>afsd</B> program exits without initializing the Cache
Manager and produces the following message on the standard output
stream&#58;
<PRE>   afsd&#58; memCache allocation failure at <VAR>number</VAR> KB
   
</PRE>
<P>where <VAR>number</VAR> is how many kilobytes were allocated just before the
failure.
<P>For a disk cache, use the <B>-blocks</B> argument to the
<B>afsd</B> command to override the value in the <B>cacheinfo</B>
file. The value specified in either way sets an absolute upper limit on
cache size; values provided for other arguments (such as
<B>-dcache</B> and <B>-chunksize</B>) never result in a larger
cache. The <B>afsd</B> program rejects any setting larger than 95%
of the partition size, and exits after generating an error message on the
standard output stream, because the cache implementation itself requires a
small amount of disk space and overfilling the partition can cause the client
machine to panic.
<P>To change the size of a disk cache after initialization without rebooting,
use the <B>fs setcachesize</B> command; the setting persists until
the <B>afsd</B> command runs again or the <B>fs setcachesize</B>
command is reissued. The <B>fs setcachesize</B> command does not
work for memory caches.
<P><LI>Sets the size of each cache <VAR>chunk</VAR>, and by implication the amount
of data that the Cache Manager requests at a time from the File Server (how
much data per fetch RPC, since AFS uses partial file transfer).
<P>For a disk cache, a chunk is a <B>V</B><VAR>n</VAR> file and this
parameter sets the maximum size to which each one can expand; the default
is 64 KB. For a memory cache, each chunk is a collection of contiguous
memory blocks; the default is size is 8 KB.
<P>To override the default chunk size for either type of cache, use the
<B>-chunksize</B> argument to provide an integer to be used as an exponent
of two; see the <B>Options</B> section for details. For a
memory cache, if total cache size divided by chunk size leaves a remainder,
the <B>afsd</B> program rounds down the number of dcache entries,
resulting in a slightly smaller cache.
<P><LI>Sets the number of chunks in the cache. For a memory cache, the
number of chunks is equal to the cache size divided by the chunk size.
For a disk cache, the number of chunks (<B>V</B><VAR>n</VAR> files) is set
to the largest of the following unless the <B>-files</B> argument is used
to set the value explicitly&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>100
<P><LI>1.5 times the result of dividing cache size by chunk size
(<VAR>cachesize</VAR>/<VAR>chunksize</VAR> * 1.5)
<P><LI>The result of dividing cachesize by 10 KB (<VAR>cachesize</VAR>/10240)
</UL>
<P><LI>Sets the number of <VAR>dcache entries</VAR> allocated in machine memory for
storing information about the chunks in the cache.
<P>For a disk cache, the <B>/usr/vice/cache/CacheItems</B> file contains
one entry for each <B>V</B><VAR>n</VAR> file. By default, one half
the number of these entries (but not more that 2,000) are duplicated as dcache
entries in machine memory for quicker access.
<P>For a memory cache, there is no <B>CacheItems</B> file so all
information about cache chunks must be in memory as dcache entries.
Thus, there is no default number of dcache entries for a memory cache;
instead, the <B>afsd</B> program derives it by dividing the cache size by
the chunk size.
<P>To set the number of dcache entries, use the <B>-dcache</B>
argument; the specified value can exceed the default limit of
2,000. Using this argument is not recommended for either type of
cache. Increasing the number of dcache entries for a disk cache
sometimes improves performance (because more entries are retrieved from memory
rather than from disk), but only marginally. Using this argument for a
memory cache requires the issuer to calculate the cache size by multiplying
this value by the chunk size.
<P><LI>Sets the number of <VAR>stat</VAR> entries available in machine memory for
caching status information about cached AFS files. The default is
300; use the <B>-stat</B> argument to override the default.
<P><LI>Randomly selects a file server machine in the local cell as the source for
the correct time. Every five minutes thereafter, the local clock is
adjusted (if necessary) to match the file server machine&#39;s clock.
<P>Use the <B>-nosettime</B> flag to prevent the <B>afsd</B> command
from selecting a time standard. This is recommended only on file server
machines that are also acting as clients. File server machines maintain
the correct time using the Network Time Protocol Daemon instead.
</UL>
<P>In addition to setting cache configuration parameters, the <B>afsd</B>
program starts the following daemons. (On most system types, these
daemons appear as nameless entries in the output of the UNIX <B>ps</B>
command.)
<UL>
<P><LI>One <I>callback</I> daemon, which handles callbacks. It also
responds to the File Server&#39;s periodic probes, which check that the
client machine is still alive.
<P><LI>One <I>maintenance</I> daemon, which performs the following
tasks&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>Garbage collects obsolete data (for example, expired tokens) from kernel
memory
<P><LI>Synchronizes files
<P><LI>Refreshes information from read-only volumes once per hour
<P><LI>Does delayed writes for NFS clients if the machine is running the NFS/AFS
Translator
</UL>
<P><LI>One <I>cache-truncation</I> daemon, which flushes the cache when free
space is required, by writing cached data and status information to the File
Server.
<P><LI>One <I>server connection</I> daemon, which sends a probe to the File
Server every few minutes to check that it is still accessible. It also
synchronizes the machine&#39;s clock with the clock on a randomly-chosen file
server machine, unless the <B>-nosettime</B> flag is used. There is
always one server connection daemon.
<P><LI>One or more <I>background</I> daemons that improve performance by
pre-fetching files and performing background (delayed) writes of saved data
into AFS. 
<P>The default number of background daemons is two, enough to service at least
five simultaneous users of the machine. To increase the number, use the
<B>-daemons</B> argument. A value greater than six is not generally
necessary.
<P><LI>On some system types, one <I>Rx listener</I> daemon, which listens for
incoming RPCs.
<P><LI>On some system types, one <I>Rx event</I> daemon, which reviews the Rx
system&#39;s queue of tasks and performs them as appropriate. Most
items in the queue are retransmissions of failed packets.
<P><LI>On machines that run AIX with virtual memory (VM) integration, one or more
<I>VM</I> daemons (sometimes called <I>I/O</I> daemons, which transfer
data between disk and machine memory. The number of them depends on the
setting of the <B>-biods</B> and <B>-daemons</B> arguments&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>If the <B>-biods</B> argument is used, it sets the number of VM
daemons.
<P><LI>If only the <B>-daemons</B> argument is used, the number of VM daemons
is twice the number of background daemons.
<P><LI>If neither argument is used, there are five VM daemons.
</UL>
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Cautions</STRONG>
<P>Do not use the <B>-shutdown</B> parameter. It does not shutdown
the Cache Manager effectively. Instead, halt Cache Manager activity by
using the standard UNIX <B>umount</B> command to unmount the AFS root
directory (by convention, <B>/afs</B>). The machine must then be
rebooted to reinitialize the Cache Manager.
<P><STRONG>Options</STRONG>
<DL>
<P><DT><B>-blocks
</B><DD>Specifies the number of kilobyte blocks to be made available for caching
in the machine&#39;s cache directory (for a disk cache) or memory (for a
memory cache), overriding the default defined in the third field of the
<B>/usr/vice/etc/cacheinfo</B> file. For a disk cache, the value
cannot exceed 95% of the space available in the cache partition. If
using a memory cache, do not combine this argument with the <B>-dcache</B>
argument, since doing so can possibly result in a chunk size that is not an
exponent of 2.
<P><DT><B>-files
</B><DD>Specifies the number of <B>V</B><VAR>n</VAR> files to create in the
cache directory for a disk cache, overriding the default that is calculated as
described in the <B>Description</B> section. Each
<B>V</B><VAR>n</VAR> file accommodates a chunk of data, and can grow to a
maximum size of 64 KB by default. Do not combine this argument with the
<B>-memcache</B> argument.
<P><DT><B>-rootvol
</B><DD>Names the read/write volume corresponding to the root directory for the
AFS file tree (which is usually the <B>/afs</B> directory). This
value overrides the default of the <B>root.afs</B> volume.
<P><DT><B>-stat
</B><DD>Specifies the number of entries to allocate in the machine&#39;s memory
for recording status information about the AFS files in the cache. This
value overrides the default of 300.
<P><DT><B>-memcache
</B><DD>Initializes a memory cache rather than a disk cache. Do not combine
this flag with the <B>-files</B> argument.
<P><DT><B>-cachedir
</B><DD>Names the local disk directory to be used as the cache. This value
overrides the default defined in the second field of the
<B>/usr/vice/etc/cacheinfo</B> file.
<P><DT><B>-mountdir
</B><DD>Names the local disk directory on which to mount the root of the AFS
filespace. This value overrides the default defined in the first field
of the <B>/usr/vice/etc/cacheinfo</B> file. If a value other than
the <B>/afs</B> directory is used, the machine cannot access the filespace
of cells that do use that value.
<P><DT><B>-daemons
</B><DD>Specifies the number of background daemons to run on the machine.
These daemons improve efficiency by doing prefetching and background writing
of saved data. This value overrides the default of 2, which is adequate
for a machine serving up to five users. Values greater than
<B>6</B> are not generally more effective than <B>6</B>. 
<P><B>Note&#58;</B> On AIX machines with integrated virtual memory (VM),
the number of VM daemons is set to twice the value of this argument, if it is
provided and the <B>-biods</B> argument is not. If both arguments
are omitted, there are five VM daemons.
<P><DT><B>-nosettime
</B><DD>Prevents the Cache Manager from synchronizing its clock with the clock on
a server machine selected at random, by checking the time on the server
machine every five minutes. Use this flag only on a machine that is
already using another time synchronization protocol (for example, a server
machine that is running the <B>runntp</B> process).
<P><DT><B>-verbose
</B><DD>Generates a detailed trace of the <B>afsd</B> program&#39;s actions
on the standard output stream.
<P><DT><B>-rmtsys
</B><DD>Initializes an additional daemon to execute AFS-specific system calls on
behalf of NFS client machines. Use this flag only if the machine is an
NFS/AFS translator machine serving users of NFS client machines who execute
AFS commands.
<A NAME="IDX4192"></A>
<P><DT><B>-debug
</B><DD>Generates a highly detailed trace of the <B>afsd</B> program&#39;s
actions on the standard output stream. The information is useful mostly
for debugging purposes.
<P><DT><B>-chunksize
</B><DD>Sets the size of each cache chunk. The integer provided, which must
be from the range <B>0</B> to <B>30</B>, is used as an exponent on the
number 2. It overrides the default of 16 for a disk cache
(2<SUP>16</SUP> is 64 KB) and 13 for a memory cache (2<SUP>13</SUP> is 8
KB). A value of <B>0</B> or less, or greater than <B>30</B>,
sets chunk size to the appropriate default. Values less than
<B>10</B> (which sets chunk size to a 1 KB) are not recommended.
Combining this argument with the <B>-dcache</B> argument is not
recommended because it requires that the issuer calculate the cache size that
results.
<P><DT><B>-dcache
</B><DD>Sets the number of dcache entries in memory, which are used to store
information about cache chunks. For a disk cache, this overrides the
default, which is 50% of the number of <B>V</B><VAR>n</VAR> files (cache
chunks). For a memory cache, this argument effectively sets the number
of cache chunks, but its use is not recommended, because it requires the
issuer to calculate the resulting total cache size (derived by multiplying
this value by the chunk size). Do not combine this argument with the
<B>-blocks</B> argument, since doing so can possibly result in a chunk
size that is not an exponent of 2.
<P><DT><B>-volumes
</B><DD>Specifies the number of memory structures to allocate for storing volume
location information. The default value is 50.
<P><DT><B>-biods
</B><DD>Sets the number of VM daemons dedicated to performing I/O operations on a
machine running a version of AIX with virtual memory (VM) integration.
If both this argument and the <B>-daemons</B> argument are omitted, the
default is five. If this argument is omitted but the
<B>-daemons</B> argument is provided, the number of VM daemons is set to
twice the value of the <B>-daemons</B> argument. 
<TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><B>Note:</B></TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">Provide this argument only on a machine that runs AIX with VM
integration.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><DT><B>-prealloc
</B><DD>Specifies the number of pieces of memory to preallocate for the Cache
Manager&#39;s internal use. The default initial value is 400, but the
Cache Manager dynamically allocates more memory as it needs it.
<P><DT><B>-confdir
</B><DD>Names a directory other than the <B>/usr/vice/etc</B> directory from
which to fetch the <B>cacheinfo</B>, <B>ThisCell</B>, and
<B>CellServDB</B> configuration files.
<P><DT><B>-logfile
</B><DD>Is obsolete and has no real effect. It specifies an alternate file
in which to record a type of trace that the Cache Manager no longer
generates; the default value is <B>/usr/vice/etc/AFSLog</B>.
<P><DT><B>-waitclose
</B><DD>Has no effect on the operation of the Cache Manager. The behavior
it affected in previous versions of the Cache Manager, to perform synchronous
writes to the File Server, is now the default behavior. To perform
asynchronous writes in certain cases, use the <B>fs storebehind</B>
command.
<P><DT><B>-shutdown
</B><DD>Shuts down the Cache Manager, but not in the most effective possible
way. Do not use this flag.
<P><DT><B>-enable_peer_stats
</B><DD>Activates the collection of Rx statistics and allocates memory for their
storage. For each connection with a specific UDP port on another
machine, a separate record is kept for each type of RPC (FetchFile, GetStatus,
and so on) sent or received. To display or otherwise access the
records, use the Rx Monitoring API.
<P><DT><B>-enable_process_stats
</B><DD>Activates the collection of Rx statistics and allocates memory for their
storage. A separate record is kept for each type of RPC (FetchFile,
GetStatus, and so on) sent or received, aggregated over all connections to
other machines. To display or otherwise access the records, use the Rx
Monitoring API.
<P><DT><B>-help
</B><DD>Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.
</DL>
<P><STRONG>Examples</STRONG>
<P>The <B>afsd</B> command is normally included in the machine&#39;s AFS
initialization file, rather than typed at the command shell prompt. For
most disk caches, the appropriate form is
<PRE>   /usr/vice/etc/afsd
   
</PRE>
<P>The following command is appropriate when enabling a machine to act as an
NFS/AFS Translator machine serving more than five users.
<PRE>   /usr/vice/etc/afsd -daemons 4 -rmtsys
   
</PRE>
<P>The following command initializes a memory cache and sets chunk size to 16
KB (2<SUP>14</SUP>).
<PRE>   /usr/vice/etc/afsd -memcache -chunksize 14
   
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Privilege Required</STRONG>
