</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Description</STRONG>
<P>The <B>fs mkmount</B> command creates a mount point for the volume
named by the <B>-vol</B> argument at the location in the AFS file space
specified by the <B>-dir</B> argument. The mount point looks like a
standard directory element, and serves as the volume&#39;s root directory,
but is actually a special file system object that refers to an AFS
volume. When the Cache Manager first encounters a given mount point
during pathname traversal, it contacts the VL Server to learn which file
server machines house the indicated volume, then fetches a copy of the
volume&#39;s root directory from the appropriate file server machine.
<P>It is possible, although not recommended, to create more than one mount
point to a volume. The Cache Manager can become confused if a volume is
mounted in two places along the same path through the filespace.
<P>The Cache Manager observes three basic rules as it traverses the AFS
filespace and encounters mount points&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI><B>Rule 1&#58;</B> Access Backup and Read-only Volumes When
Specified
<P>When the Cache Manager encounters a mount point that specifies a volume
with either a <B>.readonly</B> or a <B>.backup</B>
extension, it accesses that type of volume only. If a mount point does
not have either a <B>.backup</B> or <B>.readonly</B>
extension, the Cache Manager uses Rules 2 and 3.
<P>For example, the Cache Manager never accesses the read/write version of a
volume if the mount point names the backup version. If the specified
version is inaccessible, the Cache Manager reports an error.
<P><LI><B>Rule 2&#58;</B> Follow the Read-only Path When Possible
<P>If a mount point resides in a read-only volume and the volume that it
references is replicated, the Cache Manager attempts to access a read-only
copy of the volume; if the referenced volume is not replicated, the Cache
Manager accesses the read/write copy. The Cache Manager is thus said to
prefer a <I>read-only path</I> through the filespace, accessing read-only
volumes when they are available.
<P>The Cache Manager starts on the read-only path in the first place because
it always accesses a read-only copy of the <B>root.afs</B> volume
if it exists; the volume is mounted at the root of a cell&#39;s AFS
filespace (named <B>/afs</B> by convention). That is, if the
<B>root.afs</B> volume is replicated, the Cache Manager attempts to
access a read-only copy of it rather than the read/write copy. This
rule then keeps the Cache Manager on a read-only path as long as each
successive volume is replicated. The implication is that both the
<B>root.afs</B> and <B>root.cell</B> volumes must be
replicated for the Cache Manager to access replicated volumes mounted below
them in the AFS filespace. The volumes are conventionally mounted at
the <B>/afs</B> and <B>/afs/</B><VAR>cellname</VAR> directories,
respectively.
<P><LI><B>Rule 3&#58;</B> Once on a Read/write Path, Stay There
<P>If a mount point resides in a read/write volume and the volume name does
not have a <B>.readonly</B> or a <B>.backup</B>
extension, the Cache Manager attempts to access only the a read/write version
of the volume. The access attempt fails with an error if the read/write
version is inaccessible, even if a read-only version is accessible. In
this situation the Cache Manager is said to be on a <I>read/write path</I>
and cannot switch back to the read-only path unless mount point explicitly
names a volume with a <B>.readonly</B> extension. (Cellular
mount points are an important exception to this rule, as explained in the
following discussion.
</UL>
<P>There are three types of mount points, each appropriate for a different
purpose because of the manner in which the Cache Manager interprets
them.
<UL>
<P><LI>When the Cache Manager crosses a <I>regular</I> mount point, it obeys
all three of the mount point traversal rules previously described. To
create a regular mount point, include only the required <B>-dir</B> and
<B>-vol</B> arguments to the <B>fs mkmount</B> command. 
<A NAME="IDX4898"></A>
<A NAME="IDX4899"></A>
<TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><B>Note:</B></TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">A regular mount point does not force the Cache Manager always to access
read-only volumes (it is explicitly not a "read-only mount point"). If
a volume is not replicated, the third traversal rule means that the Cache
Manager still accesses the read/write volume when that is the only type
available. However, if the Cache Manager is to access the read-only
version of a replicated volume named by a regular mount point, all volumes
that are mounted above it in the pathname must also be replicated.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><LI>When the Cache Manager crosses a <I>read/write</I> mount point, it
attempts to access only the volume version named in the mount point. If
the volume name is the base (read/write) form, without a
<B>.readonly</B> or <B>.backup</B> extension, the Cache
Manager accesses the read/write version of the volume, even if it is
replicated. In other words, the Cache Manager disregards the second
mount point traversal rule when crossing a read/write mount point&#58; it
switches to the read/write path through the filespace. 
<A NAME="IDX4900"></A>
<A NAME="IDX4901"></A>
<P>To create a read/write mount point, include the <B>-rw</B> flag on the
<B>fs mkmount</B> command. It is conventional to create only one
read/write mount point in a cell&#39;s filespace, using it to mount the
cell&#39;s <B>root.cell</B> volume just below the AFS filespace
root (by convention, <B>/afs/.</B><VAR>cellname</VAR>). See
the <I>AFS Quick Beginnings</I> for instructions and the chapter about
volume management in the <I>AFS Administration Guide</I> for further
discussion.
<P>Creating a read/write mount point for a read-only or backup volume is
acceptable, but unnecessary. The first rule of mount point traversal
already specifies that the Cache Manager accesses them if the volume name in a
regular mount point has a <B>.readonly</B> or
<B>.backup</B> extension.
<P><LI>When the Cache Manager crosses a <I>cellular</I> mount point, it
accesses the indicated volume in the specified cell, which is normally a
foreign cell. (If the mount point does not name a cell along with the
volume, the Cache Manager accesses the volume in the cell where the mount
point resides.) The Cache Manager disregards the third mount point
traversal rule when crossing a regular cellular mount point&#58; it accesses
a read-only version of the volume if it is replicated, even if the volume that
houses the mount point is read/write. Switching to the read-only path
in this way is designed to avoid imposing undue load on the file server
machines in foreign cells.
<A NAME="IDX4902"></A>
<A NAME="IDX4903"></A>
<A NAME="IDX4904"></A>
<P>To create a regular cellular mount point, include the <B>-cell</B>
argument on the <B>fs mkmount</B> command. It is conventional to
create cellular mount points only at the second level in a cell&#39;s
filespace, using them to mount foreign cells&#39; <B>root.cell</B>
volumes just below the AFS filespace root (by convention, at
<B>/afs/</B><VAR>foreign_cellname</VAR>). The mount point enables
local users to access the foreign cell&#39;s filespace, assuming they have
the necessary permissions on the ACL of the volume&#39;s root directory and
that there is an entry for the foreign cell in each local client
machine&#39;s <B>/usr/vice/etc/CellServDB</B> file. In the output
of the <B>fs lsmount</B> command, the cell name and a colon
(<TT>&#58;</TT>) appear between the initial number sign and the volume
name in a regular cellular mount point name.
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Options</STRONG>
<DL>
<P><DT><B>-dir
</B><DD>Names the directory to create as a mount point. The directory must
not already exist. Relative pathnames are interpreted with respect to
the current working directory. 
<P>Specify the read/write path to the directory, to avoid the failure that
results from attempting to create a new mount point in a read-only
volume. By convention, the read/write path is indicated by placing a
period before the cell name at the pathname&#39;s second level (for example,
<B>/afs/.abc.com</B>). For further discussion of the
concept of read/write and read-only paths through the filespace, see the
<B>Description</B> section of this reference page.
<P><DT><B>-vol
</B><DD>Specifies the name or volume ID number of the volume to mount. If
appropriate, add the <TT>.readonly</TT> or <TT>.backup</TT>
extension to the name, or specify the appropriate volume ID number.
<P><DT><B>-cell
</B><DD>Names the cell in which the volume resides (creates a cellular mount
point). Provide the fully qualified domain name, or a shortened form
that disambiguates it from the other cells listed in the local
<B>/usr/vice/etc/CellServDB</B> file.
<P>If this argument is omitted, no cell indicator appears in the mount
point. When the Cache Manager interprets it, it assumes that the volume
named in the mount point resides in the same cell as the volume that houses
the mount point.
<P><DT><B>-rw
</B><DD>Creates a read/write mount point. Omit this flag to create a
regular mount point.
<P><DT><B>-fast
</B><DD>Prevents the Volume Location (VL) Server from checking that the volume has
a VLDB entry and printing a warning message if it does not. Whether or
not this flag is included, the File Server creates the mount point even when
the volume has no VLDB entry.
<P><DT><B>-help
</B><DD>Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.
</DL>
<P><STRONG>Examples</STRONG>
<P>The following command creates a regular mount point, mounting the volume
<B>user.smith</B> at
<B>/afs/abc.com/usr/smith</B>&#58;
<PRE>   % <B>cd /afs/abc.com/usr</B>
      
   %<B> fs mkmount -dir smith -vol user.smith</B>
   
</PRE>
<P>The following commands create a read/write mount point and a regular mount
point for the ABC Corporation cell&#39;s <TT>root.cell</TT> volume
in that cell&#39;s file tree. The second command follows the
convention of putting a period at the beginning of the read/write mount
point&#39;s name.
<PRE>   % <B>fs mkmount -dir /afs/abc.com -vol root.cell</B>
   
   %<B> fs mkmount -dir /afs/.abc.com -vol root.cell -rw</B>
   
</PRE>
<P>The following command mounts the State University cell&#39;s
<TT>root.cell</TT> volume in the ABC Corporation cell&#39;s file
tree, creating a regular cellular mount point called
<B>/afs/stateu.edu</B>. When a ABC Corporation Cache Manager
encounters this mount point, it crosses into the State University cell on a
read-only path.
<PRE>   % <B>fs mkmount -dir /afs/stateu.edu -vol root.cell -c stateu.edu</B>
   
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Privilege Required</STRONG>
<P>The issuer must have the <B>i</B> (<B>insert</B>) and <B>a</B>
(<B>administer</B>) permissions on the ACL of the directory that is to
house the mount point.
