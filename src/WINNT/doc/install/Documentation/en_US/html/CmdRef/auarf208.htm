<P><STRONG>Purpose</STRONG>
<P>Creates a new PAG
<P><STRONG>Synopsis</STRONG>
<PRE><B>pagsh</B>
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Description</STRONG>
<P>The <B>pagsh</B> command creates a new command shell (owned by the
issuer of the command) and associates a new <I>process authentication
group</I> (PAG) with the shell and the user. A PAG is a number
guaranteed to identify the issuer of commands in the new shell uniquely to the
local Cache Manager. The PAG is used, instead of the issuer&#39;s UNIX
UID, to identify the issuer in the credential structure that the Cache Manager
creates to track each user.
<P>Any tokens acquired subsequently (presumably for other cells) become
associated with the PAG, rather than with the user&#39;s UNIX UID.
This method for distinguishing users has two advantages.
<UL>
<P><LI>It means that processes spawned by the user inherit the PAG and so share
the token; thus they gain access to AFS as the authenticated user.
In many environments, for example, printer and other daemons run under
identities (such as the local superuser <B>root</B>) that the AFS server
processes recognize only as <B>anonymous</B>. Unless PAGs are used,
such daemons cannot access files in directories whose access control lists
(ACLs) do not extend permissions to the <B>system&#58;anyuser</B>
group.
<P><LI>It closes a potential security loophole&#58; UNIX allows anyone already
logged in as the local superuser <B>root</B> on a machine to assume any
other identity by issuing the UNIX <B>su</B> command. If the
credential structure is identified by a UNIX UID rather than a PAG, then the
local superuser <B>root</B> can assume a UNIX UID and use any tokens
associated with that UID. Use of a PAG as an identifier eliminates that
possibility.
</UL>
<TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><B>Note:</B></TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">The <B>pagsh.krb</B> version of this command is intended for use
by sites that employ standard Kerberos authentication for their
clients. The <B>pagsh.krb</B> command provides all the
functionality of the <B>pagsh</B> command. In addition, it defines
the environment variable KRBTKFILE (which specifies the storage location of
Kerberos tickets) to be the <B>/tmp/tktp</B><VAR>X</VAR> file (where
<VAR>X</VAR> is the number of the user&#39;s PAG). The functionality of
this command supports the placement of Kerberos tickets by the
<B>klog.krb</B> command and Kerberized AFS-modified login utilities
in the file specified by the environment variable KRBTKFILE.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><STRONG>Cautions</STRONG>
<P>Each PAG created uses two of the memory slots that the kernel uses to
record the UNIX groups associated with a user. If none of these slots
are available, the <B>pagsh</B> command fails. This is not a
problem with most operating systems, which make at least 16 slots available
per user.
<P>In cells that do not use an AFS-modified login utility, use this command to
obtain a PAG before issuing the <B>klog</B> command (or include the
<B>-setpag</B> argument to the <B>klog</B> command). If a PAG
is not acquired, the Cache Manager stores the token in a credential structure
identified by local UID rather than PAG. This creates the potential
security exposure described in the <B>Description</B> section.
<P>If users of NFS client machines for which AFS is supported are to issue
this command as part of authenticating with AFS, do not use the <B>fs
exportafs</B> command&#39;s <B>-uidcheck on</B> argument to enable UID
checking on NFS/AFS Translator machines. Enabling UID checking prevents
this command from succeeding. See the reference page for the
<B>klog</B> command.
<P>If UID checking is not enabled on Translator machines, then by default it
is possible to issue this command on a properly configured NFS client machine
that is accessing AFS via the NFS/AFS Translator, assuming that the NFS client
machine is a supported system type. The <B>pagsh</B> binary
accessed by the NFS client must be owned by, and grant setuid privilege to,
the local superuser <B>root</B>. The complete set of mode bits must
be <B>-rwsr-xr-x</B>. This is not a requirement when the command is
issued on AFS client machines.
<P>However, if the translator machine&#39;s administrator has enabled UID
checking by including the <B>-uidcheck on</B> argument to the <B>fs
exportafs</B> command, the command fails with an error message similar to
the following&#58;
<PRE>   
   Warning&#58; Remote setpag to <VAR>translator_machine</VAR>  has failed (err=8). . . 
   setpag&#58; Exec format error
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Examples</STRONG>
<P>In the following example, the issuer invokes the C shell instead of the
default Bourne shell&#58;
<PRE>   # <B>pagsh -c /bin/csh</B>
