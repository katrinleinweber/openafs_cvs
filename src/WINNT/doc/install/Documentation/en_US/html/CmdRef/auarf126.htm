</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Description</STRONG>
<P>The <B>butc</B> command initializes a Tape Coordinator process on a
Tape Coordinator machine, enabling an operator to direct Backup System
requests to the associated tape device or backup data file. (The Tape
Coordinator controls a backup data file if the <B>FILE YES</B> instruction
appears in the <B>/usr/afs/backup/CFG_</B><VAR>device_name</VAR> file that
corresponds to the Tape Coordinator&#39;s entry in the
<B>/usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig</B> file. For the sake of simplicity,
the following discusses tape devices only.)
<P>It is conventional to start and run the Tape Coordinator in the
foreground. In this case, it runs on its own connection, which is
unavailable for any other use and must remain open the entire time the Tape
Coordinator is to accept backup requests and while it is executing
them. (When using a window manager, the connection corresponds to a
separate command shell window.) The Tape Coordinator can run in the
background if the <B>CFG_</B><VAR>device_name</VAR> file is configured to
eliminate any need for the Tape Coordinator to prompt the operator. In
both the foreground and background, the Tape Coordinator writes operation
traces and other output to the standard output stream on the connection over
which it was started. Use the <B>-debuglevel</B> argument to
control the amount of information that appears. The Tape Coordinator
also writes traces and error messages to two files in the local
<B>/usr/afs/backup</B> directory&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>The <B>TE_</B><VAR>device_name</VAR> file records problems that the Tape
Coordinator encounters as it executes backup operations.
<P><LI>The <B>TL_</B><VAR>device_name</VAR> file records a trace of operations
as well as the same errors written to the <B>TE_</B><VAR>device_name</VAR>
file.
</UL>
<P>The Tape Coordinator creates the files automatically as it
initializes. If there are existing files, the Tape Coordinator renames
them with a <B>.old</B> extension, overwriting the existing
<B>.old</B> files if they exist. It derives the
<VAR>device_name</VAR> part of the file names by stripping off the device
name&#39;s <B>/dev/</B> prefix and replacing any other slashes with
underscores. For example, the files are called <B>TE_rmt_4m</B> and
<B>TL_rmt_4m</B> for a device called <B>/dev/rmt/4m</B>.
<P>By default, at the beginning of each operation the Tape Coordinator prompts
for the operator to insert the first tape into the drive and press
&lt;<B>Return</B>>. To suppress this prompt, include the
<B>-noautoquery</B> flag on the command line or the instruction
<B>AUTOQUERY NO</B> in the
<B>/usr/afs/backup/CFG_</B><VAR>device_name</VAR> file. When the
prompt is suppressed, the first required tape must be in the drive before a
<B>backup</B> command is issued. For subsequent tapes, the Tape
Coordinator uses its normal tape acquisition routine&#58; if the
<B>/usr/afs/backup/CFG_</B><VAR>device_name</VAR> file includes a
<B>MOUNT</B> instruction, the Tape Coordinator invokes the indicated
command; otherwise, it prompts the operator for the next tape.
<P>To stop the Tape Coordinator process, enter an interrupt signal such as
&lt;<B>Ctrl-c</B>> over the dedicated connection (in the command shell
window).
<P>To cancel a <B>backup</B> operation that involves a tape before it
begins (assuming the initial tape prompt has not been suppressed), enter the
letter <B>a</B> (for <B>abort</B>) and press &lt;<B>Return</B>> at
the Tape Coordinator&#39;s prompt for the first tape.
<P>Tape Coordinator operation depends on the correct configuration of certain
files, as described in the following list&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>The local <B>/usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig</B> file must include an entry
for the Tape Coordinator that specifies its device name and port offset
number, among other information; for details, see the
<B>tapeconfig</B> reference page.
<P><LI>The port offset number recorded in the Tape Coordinator&#39;s entry in
the Backup Database must match the one in the <B>tapeconfig</B>
file. Create the Backup Database entry by using the <B>backup
addhost</B> command.
<P><LI>The optional <B>/usr/afs/backup/CFG_</B><VAR>device_name</VAR> file can
contain instructions for mounting and unmounting tapes automatically (when
using a tape stacker or jukebox, for instance) or automating other aspects of
the backup process. The <VAR>device_name</VAR> part of the name is
derived as described previously for the <B>TE_</B><VAR>device_name</VAR> and
<B>TL_</B><VAR>device_name</VAR> files.
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Cautions</STRONG>
<P>If the Tape Coordinator machine is an AIX machine, use the <B>SMIT</B>
utility to set the device&#39;s block size to 0 (zero), indicating variable
block size. Otherwise, tape devices attached to machines running other
operating systems sometimes cannot read tapes written on AIX machines.
For instructions, see the <I>AFS Administration Guide</I> chapter about
configuring the Backup System.
<P><STRONG>Options</STRONG>
<DL>
<P><DT><B>-port
</B><DD>Specifies the port offset number of the Tape Coordinator to
initialize.
<P><DT><B>-debuglevel
</B><DD>Controls the amount and type of messages the Tape Coordinator displays on
the standard output stream. Provide one of three acceptable
values&#58; 
<UL>
<P><LI><B>0</B> to display the minimum level of detail required to describe
Tape Coordinator operations, including prompts for tapes, messages that
indicate the beginning and end of operations, and error messages. This
is the default value.
<P><LI><B>1</B> to display the names of the volumes being dumped or restored
as well as the information displayed at level 0.
<P><LI><B>2</B> to display all messages also being written to the
<B>TL_</B><VAR>device_name</VAR> log file.
</UL>
<P><DT><B>-cell
</B><DD>Names the cell in which the Tape Coordinator operates (the cell to which
the file server machines that house affected volumes belong). If this
argument is omitted, the Tape Coordinator runs in the local cell as defined in
the local <B>/usr/vice/etc/ThisCell</B> file. Do not combine this
flag with the <B>-localauth</B> argument.
<P><DT><B>-noautoquery
</B><DD>Suppresses the Tape Coordinator&#39;s prompt for insertion of the first
tape needed for an operation. The operator must insert the tape into
the drive before issuing the <B>backup</B> command that initializes the
operation.
<P><DT><B>-localauth
</B><DD>Constructs a server ticket using the server encryption key with the
highest key version number in the local
<B>/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile</B>. The <B>butc</B> command
interpreter presents the ticket, which never expires, to the Volume Server and
Volume Location Server to use in mutual authentication. 
<P>Do not combine this argument with the <B>-cell</B> flag, and use it
only when logged on to a server machine as the local superuser
<B>root</B>; client machines do not have
<B>/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile</B> file.
<P><DT><B>-help
</B><DD>Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.
</DL>
<P><STRONG>Examples</STRONG>
<P>The following command starts the Tape Coordinator with port offset
<B>7</B> at debug level <B>1</B>, meaning the Tape Coordinator reports
the names of volumes it is dumping or restoring.
<PRE>   % <B>butc -port 7 -debuglevel 1</B>
   
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Privilege Required</STRONG>
<P>The issuer must be listed in the <B>/usr/afs/etc/UserList</B> file on
every machine where the Backup Server or Volume Location (VL) Server is
running, and on every file server machine that houses a volume to be backed
up. If the <B>-localauth</B> flag is included, the issuer must
instead be logged on to the Tape Coordinator machine as the local superuser
<B>root.</B> In addition, the issuer must be able to read and write
to the log and configuration files in the local <B>/usr/afs/backup</B>
directory.
