</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Description</STRONG>
<P>The <B>backup deletedump</B> command deletes one or more dump records
from the Backup Database. Either use the <B>-dumpid</B> argument to
specify the dump ID number of one or more dumps, or use the <B>-from</B>
and <B>-to</B> arguments to delete the records for all regular dumps
created during the time period bracketed by the specified values.
<P>Use this command to remove dump records that are incorrect (possibly
because a dump operation was interrupted or failed), or that correspond to
dumps that are expired or otherwise no longer needed.
<P><STRONG>Cautions</STRONG>
<P>The only way to remove the dump record for an appended dump is to remove
the record for its initial dump, and doing so removes the records for all of
the initial dump&#39;s associated appended dumps.
<P>The only way to remove the record for a Backup Database dump (created with
the <B>backup savedb</B> command) is to specify its dump ID number with
the <B>-dumpid</B> argument. Using the <B>-from</B> and
<B>-to</B> arguments never removes database dump records.
<P>Removing records of a dump makes it impossible to restore data from the
corresponding tapes or from any dump that refers to the deleted dump as its
parent, directly or indirectly. That is, restore operations must begin
with the full dump and continue with each incremental dump in order. If
the records for a specific dump are removed, it is not possible to restore
data from later incremental dumps unless the deleted records are restored by
running the <B>backup scantape</B> command with the <B>-dbadd</B>
flag.
<P>If a dump set contains any dumps that were created outside the time range
specified by the <B>-from</B> and <B>-to</B> arguments, the command
does not delete any of the records associated with the dump set, even if some
of them represent dumps created during the time range.
<P><STRONG>Options</STRONG>
<DL>
<P><DT><B>-dumpid
</B><DD>Specifies the dump ID of each dump record to delete. The
corresponding dumps must be initial dumps; it is not possible to delete
appended dump records directly, but only by deleting the record of their
associated initial dump. Using this argument is the only way to delete
records of Backup Database dumps (created with the <B>backup savedb</B>
command).
<P>Provide either this argument or the <B>-to</B> (and optionally
<B>-from</B>) argument.
<P><DT><B>-from
</B><DD>Specifies the beginning of a range of dates; the record for any dump
created during the indicated period of time is deleted.
<P>Omit this argument to indicate the default of midnight (00&#58;00 hours)
on 1 January 1970 (UNIX time zero), or provide a date value in the format
<VAR>mm/dd/yyyy</VAR> [<VAR>hh&#58;MM</VAR>]. The month (<VAR>mm</VAR>),
day (<VAR>dd</VAR>), and year (<VAR>yyyy</VAR>) are required. The hour and
minutes (<VAR>hh</VAR>&#58;<VAR>MM</VAR>) are optional, but if provided must be
in 24-hour format (for example, the value <B>14&#58;36</B> represents
2&#58;36 p.m.). If omitted, the time defaults to
midnight (00&#58;00 hours).
<P>The <B>-to</B> argument must be provided along with this one.
<TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><B>Note:</B></TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">A plus sign follows this argument in the command&#39;s syntax statement
because it accepts a multiword value which does not need to be enclosed in
double quotes or other delimiters, not because it accepts multiple
dates. Provide only one date (and optionally, time) definition.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><DT><B>-to
</B><DD>Specifies the end of a range of dates; the record of any dump created
during the range is deleted from the Backup Database.
<P>Provide either the value <B>NOW</B> to indicate the current date and
time, or a date value in the same format as for the <B>-from</B>
argument. Valid values for the year (<VAR>yyyy</VAR>) range from
<B>1970</B> to <B>2037</B>; higher values are not valid because
the latest possible date in the standard UNIX representation is in February
2038. The command interpreter automatically reduces any later date to
the maximum value.
<P>If the time portion (<VAR>hh&#58;MM</VAR>) is omitted, it defaults to 59
seconds after midnight (00&#58;00&#58;59 hours). Similarly, the
<B>backup</B> command interpreter automatically adds 59 seconds to any
time value provided. In both cases, adding 59 seconds compensates for
how the Backup Database and <B>backup dumpinfo</B> command represent dump
creation times in hours and minutes only. For example, the Database
records a creation timestamp of <TT>20&#58;55</TT> for any dump operation
that begins between 20&#58;55&#58;00 and 20&#58;55&#58;59.
Automatically adding 59 seconds to a time thus includes the records for all
dumps created during that minute.
<P>Provide either this argument, or the <B>-dumpid</B> argument.
This argument is required if the <B>-from</B> argument is provided.
<P><B>Caution&#58;</B> Specifying the value <B>NOW</B> for this
argument when the <B>-from</B> argument is omitted deletes all dump
records from the Backup Database (except for Backup Database dump records
created with the <B>backup savedb</B> command).
<TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><B>Note:</B></TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">A plus sign follows this argument in the command&#39;s syntax statement

<P><DT><B>-localauth
</B><DD>Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
<B>/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile</B> file. The <B>backup</B> command
interpreter presents it to the Backup Server, Volume Server and VL Server
during mutual authentication. Do not combine this flag with the
<B>-cell</B> argument. For more details, see the introductory
<B>backup</B> reference page.
<P><DT><B>-cell
</B><DD>Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the <B>-localauth</B> flag. For more details, see the
introductory <B>backup</B> reference page.
<P><DT><B>-help
</B><DD>Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.
</DL>
<P><STRONG>Output</STRONG>
<P>At the conclusion of processing, the output lists the dump IDs of all dump
records deleted in the following format&#58;
<PRE>   The following dumps were deleted&#58;
        <VAR>dump ID 1</VAR>
        <VAR>dump ID 2</VAR>
        <VAR>etc.</VAR>
   
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Examples</STRONG>
<P>The following command deletes the dump record with dump ID 653777462, and
for any appended dumps associated with it&#58;
<PRE>   % <B>backup deletedump -dumpid 653777462</B>
   The following dumps were deleted&#58;
        653777462
   
</PRE>
<P>The following command deletes the Backup Database record of all dumps
created between midnight on 1 January 1997 and 23&#58;59&#58;59 hours on
31 December 1997&#58;
<PRE>   % <B>backup deletedump -from 01/01/1997 -to 12/31/1997</B>
   The following dumps were deleted&#58;
        598324045
        598346873
           ...
           ...
        653777523
        653779648
   
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Privilege Required</STRONG>
<P>The issuer must be listed in the <B>/usr/afs/etc/UserList</B> file on
every machine where the Backup Server is running, or must be logged onto a
server machine as the local superuser <B>root</B> if the
<B>-localauth</B> flag is included.
