</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Description</STRONG>
<P>The <B>fs storebehind</B> command enables the Cache Manager to perform
a delayed asynchronous write to the File Server when an application closes a
file. By default, the Cache Manager writes all data to the File Server
immediately and synchronously when an application program closes a
file--that is, the <B>close</B> system call does not return until the
Cache Manager has actually transferred the final chunk of the file to the File
Server. This command specifies the number of kilobytes of a file that
can still remain to be written to the File Server when the Cache Manager
returns control to the application. It is useful if users working on
the machine commonly work with very large files, but also introduces the
complications discussed in the <B>Cautions</B> section.
<P>Set either or both of the following in a single command&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>To set a value that applies to all AFS files manipulated by applications
running on the machine, use the <B>-allfiles</B> argument. This
value is termed the <I>default store asynchrony</I> for the machine, and
persists until the machine reboots. If it is not set, the default value
is zero, indicating that the Cache Manager performs synchronous writes.
<P>
<P>As an example, the following setting means that when an application closes
a file, the Cache Manager can return control to the application as soon as no
more than 10 kilobytes of the file remain to be written to the File
Server.
<PRE>   <B>-allfiles 10</B>
   
</PRE>
<P><LI>To set a value that applies to one or more individual files, and overrides
the value of the <B>-allfiles</B> argument for them, combine the
<B>-kbytes</B> and <B>-files</B> arguments. The setting
persists as long as there is an entry for the file in the kernel table that
the Cache Manager uses to track certain information about files. In
general, such an entry persists at least until an application closes the file
or exits, but the Cache Manager is free to recycle the entry if the file is
inactive and it needs to free up slots in the table. To increase the
certainty that there is an entry for the file in the table, issue the <B>fs
storebehind</B> command shortly before closing the file. 
<P>As an example, the following setting means that when an application closes
either of the files <B>bigfile</B> and <B>biggerfile</B>, the Cache
Manager can return control to the application as soon as no more than a
megabyte of the file remains to be written to the File Server.
<PRE>   <B>-kbytes 1024 -files bigfile biggerfile</B>
   
</PRE> 
<P>Note that once an explicit value has been set for a file, the only way to
make it subject to the default store asynchrony once again is to set
<B>-kbytes</B> to that value. In other words, there is no
combination of arguments that automatically makes a file subject to the
default store asynchrony once another value has been set for the file.
</UL>
<P>To display the settings that currently apply to individual files or to all
files, provide the command&#39;s arguments in certain combinations as
specified in the <B>Output</B> section of this reference page.
<P><STRONG>Cautions</STRONG>
<P>For the following reasons, use of this command is not recommended in most
cases.
<P>In normal circumstances, an asynchronous setting results in the Cache
Manager returning control to applications earlier than it otherwise does, but
this is not guaranteed.
<P>If a delayed write fails, there is no way to notify the application, since
the <B>close</B> system call has already returned with a code indicating
success.
<P>Writing asynchronously increases the possibility that the user will not
notice if a write operation makes the volume that houses the file exceed its
quota. As always, the portion of the file that exceeds the
volume&#39;s quota is lost, which prompts a message such as the
following&#58;
<PRE>   No space left on device
   
</PRE>
<P>To avoid losing data, it is advisable to verify that the volume housing the
file has space available for the amount of data anticipated to be
written.
<P><STRONG>Options</STRONG>
<DL>
<P><DT><B>-kbytes
</B><DD>Specifies the number of kilobytes of data from each file named by the
<B>-files</B> argument that can remain to be written to the file server
when the Cache Manager returns control to an application program that closed
the file. The <B>-files</B> argument is required along with this
argument. Provide an integer from the range <B>0</B> (which
reinstates the Cache Manager&#39;s default behavior or writing synchronously)
to the maximum AFS file size.
<P><DT><B>-files
</B><DD>Names each file to which the value set with the <B>-kbytes</B>
argument applies. The setting persists as long as there is an entry for
the file in the kernel table that the Cache Manager uses to track certain
information about files. Because closing a file generally erases the
entry, when reopening a file the only way to guarantee that the setting still
applies is to reissue the command. If this argument is provided without
the <B>-kbytes</B> argument, the command reports the current setting for
the specified files, and the default store asynchrony.
<P><DT><B>-allfiles
</B><DD>Sets the default store asynchrony for the local machine, which is the
number of kilobytes of data that can remain to be written to the file server
when the Cache Manager returns control to the application program that closed
a file. The value applies to all AFS files manipulated by applications
running on the machine, except those for which settings have been made with
the <B>-kbytes</B> and <B>-files</B> arguments. Provide an
integer from the range <B>0</B> (which indicates the default of
synchronous writes) to the maximum AFS file size.
<P><DT><B>-verbose
</B><DD>Produces output confirming the settings made with the accompanying
<B>-kbytes</B> and <B>-files</B> arguments, the <B>-allfiles</B>
argument, or all three. If provided by itself, reports the current
default store asynchrony.
<P><DT><B>-help
</B><DD>Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.
</DL>
<P><STRONG>Output</STRONG>
<P>If none of the command&#39;s options are included, or if only the
<B>-verbose</B> flag is included, the following message reports the
default store asynchrony (the setting that applies to all files manipulated by
applications running on the local machine and for which not more specific
asynchrony is set).
<PRE>   Default store asynchrony is <VAR>x</VAR> kbytes.
   
</PRE>
<P>A value of <TT>0</TT> (zero) indicates synchronous writes and is the
default if no one has included the <B>-allfiles</B> argument on this
command since the machine last rebooted.
<P>If the <B>-files</B> argument is provided without the
<B>-kbytes</B> argument, the output reports the value that applies to each
specified file along with the default store asynchrony. If a particular
value has previously been set for a file, the following message reports
it&#58;
<PRE>   Will store up to <VAR>y</VAR> kbytes of <VAR>file</VAR> asynchronously.
   Default store asynchrony is <VAR>x</VAR> kbytes.
   
</PRE>
<P>If the default store asynchrony applies to a file because no explicit
<B>-kbytes</B> value has been set for it, the message is instead as
follows&#58;
<PRE>   Will store <VAR>file</VAR> according to default.
   Default store asynchrony is <VAR>x</VAR> kbytes.
   
</PRE>
<P>If the <B>-verbose</B> flag is combined with arguments that set values
(<B>-files</B> and <B>-kbytes</B>, or <B>-allfiles</B>, or all
three), there is a message that confirms immediately that the setting has
taken effect. When included without other arguments or flags, the
<B>-verbose</B> flag reports the default store asynchrony only.
<P><STRONG>Examples</STRONG>
<P>The following command enables the Cache Manager to return control to the
application program that closed the file <B>test.data</B> when 100
kilobytes still remain to be written to the File Server. The
<B>-verbose</B> flag produces output that confirms the new setting, and
that the default store asynchrony is zero.
<PRE>   % <B>fs storebehind -kbytes 100 -files test.data -verbose</B>
   Will store up to 100 kbytes of test.data asynchronously.
   Default store asynchrony is 0 kbytes.
   
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Privilege Required</STRONG>
<P>To include the <B>-allfiles</B> argument, the issuer must be logged in
as the local superuser <B>root</B>.
<P>To include the <B>-kbytes</B> and <B>-files</B> arguments, the
issuer must either be logged in as the local superuser <B>root</B> or have
the <B>w</B> (<B>write</B>) permission on the ACL of each file&#39;s
directory.
<P>To view the current settings (by including no arguments, the
<B>-file</B> argument alone, or the <B>-verbose</B> argument alone),
no privilege is required.
