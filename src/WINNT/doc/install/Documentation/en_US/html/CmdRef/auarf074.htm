</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Description</STRONG>
<P>The <B>backup dumpinfo</B> command formats and displays the Backup
Database record for the specified dumps. To specify how many of the
most recent dumps to display, starting with the newest one and going back in
time, use the <B>-ndumps</B> argument. To display more detailed
information about a single dump, use the <B>-id</B> argument. To
display the records for the 10 most recent dumps, omit both the
<B>-ndumps</B> and <B>-id</B> arguments.
<P>The <B>-verbose</B> flag produces very detailed information that is
useful mostly for debugging purposes. It can be combined only with the
<B>-id</B> argument.
<P><STRONG>Options</STRONG>
<DL>
<P><DT><B>-ndumps
</B><DD>Displays the Backup Database record for each of the specified number of
dumps that were most recently performed. If the database contains fewer
dumps than are requested, the output includes the records for all existing
dumps. Do not combine this argument with the <B>-id</B> or
<B>-verbose</B> options; omit all options to display the records for
the last 10 dumps.
<P><DT><B>-id
</B><DD>Specifies the dump ID number of a single dump for which to display the
Backup Database record. Precede the <VAR>dump id</VAR> value with the
<B>-id</B> switch; otherwise, the command interpreter interprets it
as the value of the <B>-ndumps</B> argument. Combine this argument
with the <B>-verbose</B> flag, but not with the <B>-ndumps</B>
argument; omit all options to display the records for the last 10
dumps.
<P><DT><B>-verbose
</B><DD>Provides more detailed information about the dump specified with the
<B>-id</B> argument, which must be provided along with it. Do not
combine this flag with the <B>-ndumps</B> argument.
<P><DT><B>-localauth
</B><DD>Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
<B>/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile</B> file. The <B>backup</B> command
interpreter presents it to the Backup Server, Volume Server and VL Server
during mutual authentication. Do not combine this flag with the
<B>-cell</B> argument. For more details, see the introductory
<B>backup</B> reference page.
<P><DT><B>-cell
</B><DD>Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the <B>-localauth</B> flag. For more details, see the
introductory <B>backup</B> reference page.
<P><DT><B>-help
</B><DD>Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.
</DL>
<P><STRONG>Output</STRONG>
<P>If the <B>-ndumps</B> argument is provided, the output presents the
following information in table form, with a separate line for each dump&#58;
<DL>
<P><DT><B><TT>dumpid</TT>
</B><DD>The dump ID number.
<P><DT><B><TT>parentid</TT>
</B><DD>The dump ID number of the dump&#39;s parent dump. A value of
<TT>0</TT> (zero) identifies a full dump.
<P><DT><B><TT>lv</TT>
</B><DD>The depth in the dump hierarchy of the dump level used to create the
dump. A value of <TT>0</TT> (zero) identifies a full dump, in which
case the value in the <TT>parentid</TT> field is also <TT>0</TT>. A
value of <TT>1</TT> or greater indicates an incremental dump made at the
corresponding level in the dump hierarchy.
<P><DT><B><TT>created</TT>
</B><DD>The date and time at which the Backup System started the dump operation
that created the dump.
<P><DT><B><TT>nt</TT>
</B><DD>The number of tapes that contain the data in the dump. A value of
<TT>0</TT> (zero) indicates that the dump operation was terminated or
failed. Use the <B>backup deletedump</B> command to remove such
entries.
<P><DT><B><TT>nvols</TT>
</B><DD>The number of volumes from which the dump includes data. If a
volume spans tapes, it is counted twice. A value of <TT>0</TT> (zero)
indicates that the dump operation was terminated or failed; the value in
the <TT>nt</TT> field is also <TT>0</TT> in this case.
<P><DT><B><TT>dump name</TT>
</B><DD>The dump name in the form 
<PRE>   <VAR>volume_set_name</VAR>.<VAR>dump_level_name</VAR> (<VAR>initial_dump_ID</VAR>)
   
</PRE>
<P>
<P>where <VAR>volume_set_name</VAR> is the name of the volume set, and
<VAR>dump_level_name</VAR> is the last element in the dump level pathname at
which the volume set was dumped.
<P>The <VAR>initial_dump_ID</VAR>, if displayed, is the dump ID of the initial
dump in the dump set to which this dump belongs. If there is no value
in parentheses, the dump is the initial dump in a dump set that has no
appended dumps.
</DL>
<P>If the <B>-id</B> argument is provided alone, the first line of output
begins with the string <TT>Dump</TT> and reports information for the entire
dump in the following fields&#58;
<DL>
<P><DT><B><TT>id</TT>
</B><DD>The dump ID number.
<P><DT><B><TT>level</TT>
</B><DD>The depth in the dump hierarchy of the dump level used to create the
dump. A value of <TT>0</TT> (zero) identifies a full dump. A
value of <TT>1</TT> (one) or greater indicates an incremental dump made at
the specified level in the dump hierarchy.
<P><DT><B><TT>volumes</TT>
</B><DD>The number of volumes for which the dump includes data.
<P><DT><B><TT>created</TT>
</B><DD>The date and time at which the dump operation began.
</DL>
<P>Following a blank line, the output includes an entry for each tape that
houses volume data from the dump. Following the string <TT>Tape</TT>,
the first two lines of each entry report information about that tape in the
following fields&#58;
<DL>
<P><DT><B><TT>name</TT>
</B><DD>The tape&#39;s permanent name if it has one, or its AFS tape name
otherwise, and its tape ID number in parentheses.
<P><DT><B><TT>nVolumes</TT>
</B><DD>The number of volumes for which this tape includes dump data.
<P><DT><B><TT>created</TT>
</B><DD>The date and time at which the Tape Coordinator began writing data to this
tape.
</DL>
<P>Following another blank line, the tape-specific information concludes with
a table that includes a line for each volume dump on the tape. The
information appears in columns with the following headings&#58;
<DL>
<P><DT><B><TT>Pos</TT>
</B><DD>The relative position of each volume in this tape or file. On a
tape, the counter begins at position 2 (the tape label occupies position 1),
and increments by one for each volume. For volumes in a backup data
file, the position numbers start with 1 and do not usually increment only by
one, because each is the ordinal of the 16 KB offset in the file at which the
volume&#39;s data begins. The difference between the position numbers
therefore indicates how many 16 KB blocks each volume&#39;s data
occupies. For example, if the second volume is at position 5 and the
third volume in the list is at position 9, that means that the dump of the
second volume occupies 64 KB (four 16-KB blocks) of space in the file.
<P><DT><B><TT>Clone time</TT>
</B><DD>For a backup or read-only volume, the time at which it was cloned from its
read/write source. For a Read/Write volume, it is the same as the dump
creation date reported on the first line of the output.
<P><DT><B><TT>Nbytes</TT>
</B><DD>The number of bytes of data in the dump of the volume.
<P><DT><B><TT>Volume</TT>
</B><DD>The volume name, complete with <TT>.backup</TT> or
<TT>.readonly</TT> extension if appropriate.
</DL>
<P>If both the <B>-id</B> argument and the <B>-verbose</B> flag are
specified, the output is divided into several sections&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>The first section, headed by the underlined string <TT>Dump</TT>,
includes information about the entire dump. The fields labeled
<TT>id</TT>, <TT>level</TT>, <TT>created</TT>, and <TT>nVolumes</TT>
report the same values (though in a different order) as appear on the first
line of output when the <B>-id</B> argument is provided by itself.
Other fields of potential interest to the backup operator are&#58; 
<DL>
<P><DT><B><TT>maxTapes</TT>
</B><DD>The number of tapes that contain the dump set to which this dump
belongs.
<P><DT><B><TT>Start Tape Seq</TT>
</B><DD>The ordinal of the tape on which this dump begins in the set of tapes that
contain the dump set.
</DL>
<P><LI>For each tape that contains data from this dump, there follows a section
headed by the underlined string <TT>Tape</TT>. The fields labeled
<TT>name</TT>, <TT>written</TT>, and <TT>nVolumes</TT> report the same
values (though in a different order) as appear on the second and third lines
of output when the <B>-id</B> argument is provided by itself. Other
fields of potential interest to the backup operator are&#58; 
<DL>
<P><DT><B><TT>expires</TT>
</B><DD>The date and time when this tape can be recycled, because all dumps it
contains have expired.
<P><DT><B><TT>nMBytes Data</TT> and <TT>nBytes Data</TT>
</B><DD>Summed together, these fields represent the total amount of dumped data
actually from volumes (as opposed to labels, filemarks, and other
markers).
<P><DT><B><TT>KBytes Tape Used</TT>
</B><DD>The number of kilobytes of tape (or disk space, for a backup data file)
used to store the dump data. It is generally larger than the sum of the
values in the <TT>nMBytes Data</TT> and <TT>nBytes Data</TT> fields,
because it includes the space required for the label, file marks and other
markers, and because the Backup System writes data at 16 KB offsets, even if
the data in a given block doesn&#39;t fill the entire 16 KB.
</DL>
<P><LI>For each volume on a given tape, there follows a section headed by the
underlined string <TT>Volume</TT>. The fields labeled
<TT>name</TT>, <TT>position</TT>, <TT>clone</TT>, and <TT>nBytes</TT>
report the same values (though in a different order) as appear in the table
that lists the volumes in each tape when the <B>-id</B> argument is
provided by itself. Other fields of potential interest to the backup
operator are&#58; 
<DL>
<P><DT><B><TT>id</TT>
</B><DD>The volume ID.
<P><DT><B><TT>tape</TT>
</B><DD>The name of the tape containing this volume data.
</DL>
</UL>
