</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Description</STRONG>
<P>The <B>klog</B> command obtains an AFS token from the Authentication
Server. The Cache Manager on the local machine stores the token in a
credential structure in kernel memory and uses it when obtaining authenticated
access to the AFS filespace. This command does not affect the
issuer&#39;s identity (UNIX UID) in the local file system.
<P>By default, the command interpreter obtains a token for the AFS user name
that matches the issuer&#39;s identity in the local file system. To
specify an alternate user, include the <B>-principal</B> argument.
The user named by the <B>-principal</B> argument does not have to appear
in the local password file (the <B>/etc/passwd</B> file or
equivalent).
<P>By default, the command interpreter obtains a token for the local cell, as
defined by the AFSCELL environment variable set in the command shell or by the
<B>/usr/vice/etc/ThisCell</B> file on the local machine. To specify
an alternate cell, include the <B>-cell</B> argument. The command
interpreter contacts an Authentication Server chosen at random from the
cell&#39;s entry in the local <B>/usr/afs/etc/CellServDB</B> file, unless
the <B>-servers</B> argument is used to name one or more database server
machines.
<P>A user can have tokens in multiple cells simultaneously, but only one token
per cell per connection to the client machine. If the user&#39;s
credential structure already contains a token for the requested cell, the
token resulting from this command replaces it.
<P>Sites that employ standard Kerberos authentication instead of the AFS
Authentication Server must use the Kerberos version of this command,
<B>klog.krb</B>, on all client machines. It automatically
places the issuer&#39;s Kerberos tickets in the file named by the KRBTKFILE
environment variable, which the <B>pagsh.krb</B> command defines
automatically as <B>/tmp/tktp</B><I>X</I> where <I>X</I> is the
number of the user&#39;s PAG.
<P>The lifetime of the token resulting from this command is the smallest of
the following. 
<UL>
<P><LI>The lifetime specified by the issuer with the <B>-lifetime</B>
argument. If the issuer does not include this argument, the value
defaults to 720 hours (30 days).
<P><LI>The maximum ticket lifetime recorded for the <B>afs</B> entry in the
Authentication Database. The default is 100 hours.
<P><LI>The maximum ticket lifetime recorded in the specified user&#39;s
Authentication Database entry. The default is 25 hours for user entries
created by an Authentication Server running AFS 3.1 or later.
<P><LI>The maximum ticket lifetime recorded in the
<B>krbtgt.</B><VAR>CELLNAME</VAR> entry in the Authentication
Database; this entry corresponds to the ticket-granting ticket used
internally in generating the token. The default is 720 hours (30
days).
</UL>
<P>The output from the <B>kas examine</B> command displays an
Authentication Database entry&#39;s maximum ticket lifetime as <TT>Max
ticket lifetime</TT>. Administrators can display any entry, and users
can display their own entries.
<P>If none of the defaults have been changed, the token lifetime is 25 hours
for user accounts created by an Authentication Server running AFS 3.1
or higher. The maximum lifetime for any token is 720 hours (30 days),
and the minimum is 5 minutes.
<P>Between the minimum and maximum values, the Authentication Server uses a
defined set of values, according to the following rules. Requested
lifetimes between 5 minutes and 10 hours 40 minutes are granted at 5 minute
intervals, rounding up. For example, if the issuer requests a lifetime
of 12 minutes, the token&#39;s actual lifetime is 15 minutes.
<P>For token lifetimes greater than 10 hours 40 minutes, consult the following
table, which presents all the possible times in units of
<VAR>hours</VAR><B>&#58;</B><VAR>minutes</VAR><B>&#58;</B><VAR>seconds</VAR>.
The number in parentheses is an approximation of the corresponding time in
days and hours (as indicated by the <TT>d</TT> and <TT>h</TT>
letters). For example, <TT>282&#58;22&#58;17</TT> means 282
hours, 22 minutes, and 17 seconds, which translates to approximately 11 days
and 18 hours (<TT>11d 18h</TT>). The Authentication Server rounds up
a requested lifetime to the next highest possible lifetime.

</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Cautions</STRONG>
<P>By default, this command does not create a new process authentication group
(PAG); see the description of the <B>pagsh</B> command to learn about
PAGs. If a cell does not use an AFS-modified login utility, users must
include <B>-setpag</B> option to this command, or issue the
<B>pagsh</B> command before this one, to have their tokens stored in a
credential structure that is identified by PAG rather than by local
UID.
<P>When a credential structure is identified by local UID, the potential
security exposure is that the local superuser <B>root</B> can use the UNIX
<B>su</B> command to assume any other identity and automatically inherit
the tokens associated with that UID. Identifying the credential
structure by PAG eliminates this exposure.
<P>If the <B>-password</B> argument is used, the specified password cannot
begin with a hyphen, because it is interpreted as another option name.
Use of the <B>-password</B> argument is not recommended in any
case.
<P>By default, it is possible to issue this command on a properly configured
NFS client machine that is accessing AFS via the NFS/AFS Translator, assuming
that the NFS client machine is a supported system type. However, if the
translator machine&#39;s administrator has enabled UID checking by including
the <B>-uidcheck on</B> argument to the <B>fs exportafs</B> command,
the command fails with an error message similar to the following&#58;
<PRE>   
   Warning&#58; Remote pioctl to <VAR>translator_machine</VAR>  has failed (err=8). . . 
   Unable to authenticate to AFS because a pioctl failed.
</PRE>
<P>Enabling UID checking means that the credential structure in which tokens
are stored on the translator machine must be identified by a UID that matches
the local UID of the process that is placing the tokens in the credential
structure. After the <B>klog</B> command interpreter obtains the
token on the NFS client, it passes it to the remote executor daemon on the
translator machine, which makes the system call that stores the token in a
credential structure on the translator machine. The remote executor
generally runs as the local superuser <B>root</B>, so in most cases its
local UID (normally zero) does not match the local UID of the user who issued
the <B>klog</B> command on the NFS client machine.
<P>Issuing the <B>klog</B> command on an NFS client machine creates a
security exposure&#58; the command interpreter passes the token across the
network to the remote executor daemon in clear text mode.
<P><STRONG>Options</STRONG>
<DL>
<P><DT><B>-x
</B><DD>Appears only for backwards compatibility. Its former function is
now the default behavior of this command.
<P><DT><B>-principal
</B><DD>Specifies the user name to authenticate. If this argument is
omitted, the Authentication Server attempts to authenticate the user logged
into the local file system.
<P><DT><B>-password
</B><DD>Specifies the issuer&#39;s password (or that of the alternate user
identified by the <B>-principal</B> argument). Omit this argument
to have the command interpreter prompt for the password, in which case it does
not echo visibly in the command shell.
<P><DT><B>-cell
</B><DD>Specifies the cell for which to obtain a token. The command is
directed to that cell&#39;s Authentication Servers. During a single
login session on a given machine, a user can be authenticated in multiple
cells simultaneously, but can have only one token at a time for each of them
(that is, can only authenticate under one identity per cell per session on a
machine). It is acceptable to abbreviate the cell name to the shortest
form that distinguishes it from the other cells listed in the
<B>/usr/vice/etc/CellServDB</B> file on the client machine on which the
command is issued.
<P>If this argument is omitted, the command is executed in the local cell, as
defined 
<UL>
<P><LI>First, by the value of the environment variable AFSCELL
<P><LI>Second, in the <B>/usr/vice/etc/ThisCell</B> file on the client
machine on which the command is issued
</UL>
<P><DT><B>-servers
</B><DD>Establishes a connection with the Authentication Server running on each
specified database server machine. The command interpreter then chooses
one of these at random to execute the command. It is best to provide
fully-qualified hostnames, but abbreviated forms are possibly acceptable
depending on the state of the cell&#39;s name server at the time the command
is issued. This option is useful for testing specific servers if
problems are encountered.
<P>If this argument is omitted, the command interpreter establishes a
connection with each machine listed for the indicated cell in the local copy
of the <B>/usr/vice/etc/CellServDB</B> file, and then chooses one of them
at random for command execution.
<P><DT><B>-pipe
</B><DD>Suppresses all output to the standard output stream, including prompts and
error messages. The <B>klog</B> command interpreter expects to
receive the password from the standard input stream. Do not use this
argument; it is designed for use by application programs rather than
human users.
<P><DT><B>-silent
</B><DD>Suppresses some of the trace messages that the <B>klog</B> command
produces on the standard output stream by default. It still reports on
major problems encountered.
<P><DT><B>-lifetime
</B><DD>Requests a specific lifetime for the token. Provide a number of
hours and optionally minutes and seconds in the format
<VAR>hh</VAR>[<B>&#58;</B><VAR>mm</VAR>[<B>&#58;</B><VAR>ss</VAR>]].
The value is used in calculating the token lifetime as described in the
<B>Description</B> section.
<P><DT><B>-setpag
</B><DD>Creates a process authentication group (PAG) prior to requesting
authentication. The token is associated with the newly created
PAG.
<P><DT><B>-tmp
</B><DD>Creates a Kerberos-style ticket file in the <B>/tmp</B> directory of
the local machine. The file is called
<B>tkt.</B><VAR>AFS_UID</VAR> where <VAR>AFS_UID</VAR> is the AFS UID
of the issuer.
<P><DT><B>-help
</B><DD>Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.
</DL>
<P><STRONG>Cautions</STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Output</STRONG>
<P>The following message indicates that the limit on consecutive
authentication failures has been exceeded. An administrator can use the
<B>kas unlock</B> command to unlock the account, or the issuer can wait
until the lockout time for the account has passed. (The time is set
with the <B>-locktime</B> argument to the <B>kas setfields</B> command
and displayed in the output from the <B>kas examine</B> command).
<PRE>   
   Unable to authenticate to AFS because ID is locked - see your system admin
   
</PRE>
<P>If the <B>-tmp</B> flag is included, the following message confirms
that a Kerberos-style ticket file was created&#58;
<PRE>   
   Wrote ticket file to /tmp
   
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Examples</STRONG>
<P>Most often, this command is issued without arguments. The
appropriate password is for the person currently logged into the local file
system. The ticket&#39;s lifetime is calculated as described in the
<B>Description</B> section (if no defaults have been changed, it is 25
hours for a user whose Authentication Database entry was created in AFS
3.1 or later).
<PRE>   
   % <B>klog</B>
   Password&#58; 
   
</PRE>
<P>The following example authenticates the user as <B>admin</B> in the ABC
Corporation&#39;s test cell&#58;
<PRE>   
   % <B>klog -principal admin -cell test.abc.com</B>
   Password&#58; 
   
</PRE>
<P>In the following, the issuer requests a ticket lifetime of 104 hours 30
minutes (4 days 8 hours 30 minutes). Presuming that this lifetime is
allowed by the maximum ticket lifetimes and other factors described in the
<B>Description</B> section, the token&#39;s lifetime is
110&#58;44&#58;28, which is the next largest possible value.
