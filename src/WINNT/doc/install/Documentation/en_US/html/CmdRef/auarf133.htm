</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Description</STRONG>
<P>The <B>fs checkservers</B> command reports whether certain AFS server
machines are accessible from the local client machine. The machines
belong to one of two classes, and the Cache Manager maintains a list of them
in kernel memory&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>The database server machines in every cell listed in the local
<B>/usr/vice/etc/CellServDB file</B>, plus any machines added to the
memory list by the <B>fs newcell</B> command since the last reboot.
<P><LI>All file server machines the Cache Manager has recently contacted, and
which it probably needs to contact again soon. In most cases, the Cache
Manager holds a callback on a file or volume fetched from the machine.
</UL>
<P>If the Cache Manager is unable to contact the <B>vlserver</B> process
on a database server machine or the <B>fileserver</B> process on a file
server machine, it marks the machine as inaccessible. (Actually, if a
file server machine is multihomed, the Cache Manager attempts to contact all
of the machine&#39;s interfaces, and only marks the machine as down if the
<B>fileserver</B> fails to reply via any of them.) The Cache
Manager then periodically (by default, every three minutes) sends a probe to
each marked machine, to see if it is still inaccessible. If a
previously inaccessible machine responds, the Cache Manager marks it as
accessible and no longer sends the periodic probes to it.
<P>The <B>fs checkservers</B> command updates the list of inaccessible
machines by having the Cache Manager probe a specified set of them&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>By default, only machines that are marked inaccessible and belong to the
local cell (the cell listed in the local <B>/usr/vice/etc/ThisCell</B>
file)
<P><LI>If the <B>-cell</B> argument is included, only machines that are
marked inaccessible and belong to the specified cell
<P><LI>If the <B>-all</B> flag is included, all machines marked inaccessible
</UL>
<P>If the <B>-fast</B> flag is included, the Cache Manager does not probe
any machines, but instead reports the results of the most recent previous
probe.
<P>To set the interval between probes rather than produce a list of
inaccessible machines, use the <B>-interval</B> argument. The
non-default setting persists until the machine reboots; to preserve it
across reboots, put the appropriate <B>fs checkservers</B> command in the
machine&#39;s AFS initialization files.
<P><STRONG>Cautions</STRONG>
<P>The command can take quite a while to complete, if a number of machines do
not respond to the Cache Manager&#39;s probe. The Cache Manager probes
machines sequentially and waits a standard timeout period before marking the
machine as unresponsive, to allow for slow network communication. To
make the command shell prompt return quickly, put the command in the
background. It is harmless to interrupt the command by typing
<B>Ctrl-c</B> or another interrupt signal.
<P>Note that the Cache Manager probes only server machines marked inaccessible
in its memory list. A server machine&#39;s absence from the output
does not necessarily mean that it is functioning, because it possibly is not
included in the memory list at all (if, for example, the Cache Manager has not
contacted it recently). For the same reason, the output is likely to
vary on different client machines.
<P>Unlike most <B>fs</B> commands, the <B>fs checkservers</B> command
does not refer to the AFSCELL environment variable.
<P><STRONG>Options</STRONG>
<DL>
<P><DT><B>-cell
</B><DD>Names each cell in which to probe server machines marked as
inaccessible. Provide the fully qualified domain name, or a shortened
form that disambiguates it from the other cells listed in the local
<B>/usr/vice/etc/CellServDB</B> file. Combine this argument with
the <B>-fast</B> flag if desired, but not with the <B>-all</B>
flag. Omit both this argument and the <B>-all</B> flag to probe
machines in the local cell only.
<P><DT><B>-all
</B><DD>Probes all machines in the Cache Manager&#39;s memory list that are
marked inaccessible. Combine this argument with the <B>-fast</B>
flag if desired, but not with the <B>-cell</B> argument. Omit both
this flag and the <B>-cell</B> argument to probe machines in the local
cell only.
<P><DT><B>-fast
</B><DD>Displays the Cache Manager&#39;s current list of machines that are
inaccessible, rather than sending new probes. The output can as old as
the current setting of the probe interval (by default three minutes, and
maximum ten minutes).
<P><DT><B>-interval
</B><DD>Sets or reports the number of seconds between the Cache Manager&#39;s
probes to machines in the memory list that are marked inaccessible&#58; 
<UL>
<P><LI>To set the interval, specify a value from the range between <B>1</B>
and <B>600</B> (10 minutes); the default is <B>180</B> (three
minutes). The issuer must be logged in as the local superuser
<B>root</B>. The altered setting persists until again changed with
this command, or until the machine reboots, at which time the setting returns
to the default.
<P><LI>Provide a value of <B>0</B> (zero) to display the current interval
setting. No privilege is required. Do not combine this argument
with any other.
</UL>
<P><DT><B>-help
</B><DD>Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.
</DL>
<P><STRONG>Output</STRONG>
<P>If there are no machines marked as inaccessible, or if all of them now
respond to the Cache Manager&#39;s probe, the output is&#58;
<PRE>   All servers are running.
   
</PRE>
<P>Note that this message does not mean that all server machines in each
relevant cell are running. The output indicates the status of only
those machines that the Cache Manager probes.
<P>If a machine fails to respond to the probe within the timeout period, the
output begins with the string
<PRE>   These servers unavailable due to network or server problems&#58;
   
</PRE>
<P>and lists the hostname of each machine on its own line. The Cache
Manager stores machine records by Internet address, so the format of each
hostname (uppercase or lowercase letters, or an Internet address in dotted
decimal format) depends on how the local cell&#39;s name service translates
it at the time the command is issued. If a server machine is
multihomed, the output lists only one of its interfaces (usually, the
currently most preferred one).
<P>If the <B>-interval</B> argument is provided with a value between
<B>1</B> and <B>600</B>, there is no output. If the value is
<B>0</B>, the output reports the probe interval as follows&#58;
<PRE>   The current down server probe interval is <VAR>interval</VAR> secs
   
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Examples</STRONG>
<P>The following command displays the Cache Manager&#39;s current list of
unresponsive machines in the local cell, rather than probing them
again. The output indicates that if there were any machines marked
inaccessible, they all responded to the previous probe.
<PRE>   % <B>fs checkservers -fast</B>
   All servers are running.
   
</PRE>
<P>The following example probes machines in the Cache Manager&#39;s memory
list that belong to the <B>stateu.edu</B> cell&#58;
<PRE>   % <B>fs checkservers -cell stateu.edu</B>
   All servers are running.
   
</PRE>
<P>The following example probes all server machines in the Cache
Manager&#39;s memory list. It reports that two machines did not
respond to the probe.
<PRE>   % <B>fs checkservers -all</B>
   These servers unavailable due to network or server problems&#58;
   fs1.abc.com SV3.STATE.EDU.
   
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Privilege Required</STRONG>
<P>To set the probe interval, the issuer must be logged in as the local
superuser <B>root</B>. Otherwise, no privilege is required.
