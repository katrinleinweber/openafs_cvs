<P>This command does not use the syntax conventions of the AFS command
suites. Provide the command name and all option names in full.
<P><STRONG>Description</STRONG>
<P>The <B>salvager</B> command initializes the Salvager component of the
<B>fs</B> process. In the conventional configuration, its binary
file is located in the <B>/usr/afs/bin</B> directory on a file server
machine.
<P>The Salvager restores internal consistency to corrupted read/write volumes
on the local file server machine where possible. For read-only or
backup volumes, it inspects only the volume header&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>If the volume header is corrupted, the Salvager removes the volume
completely and records the removal in its log file,
<B>/usr/afs/logs/SalvageLog</B>. Issue the <B>vos release</B>
or <B>vos backup</B> command to create the read-only or backup volume
again.
<P><LI>If the volume header is intact, the Salvager skips the volume (does not
check for corruption in the contents). However, if the File Server
notices corruption as it initializes, it sometimes refuses to attach the
volume or bring it online. In this case, it is simplest to remove the
volume by issuing the <B>vos remove</B> or <B>vos zap</B>
command. Then issue the <B>vos release</B> or <B>vos backup</B>
command to create it again.
</UL>
<P>Unlike other server process initialization commands, the
<B>salvager</B> command is designed to be issued at the command shell
prompt, as well as being placed into a file server machine&#39;s
<B>/usr/afs/local/BosConfig</B> file with the <B>bos create</B>
command. It is also possible to invoke the Salvager remotely by issuing
the <B>bos salvage</B> command.
<P>Combine the command&#39;s options as indicated to salvage different
numbers of read/write volumes&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>To salvage all volumes on the file server machine, provide no
arguments. No volumes on the machine are accessible to Cache Managers
during the salvage, because the BOS Server stops the File Server and Volume
Server processes while the Salvager runs.
<P><LI>To salvage all of the volumes on one partition, provide the
<B>-partition</B> argument. As for a salvage of all volumes on the
machine, no volumes on the machine are accessible to Cache Managers during the
salvage operation.
<P><LI>To salvage only one volume, combine the <B>-partition</B> and
<B>-volumeid</B> arguments. Only that volume is inaccessible to
Cache Managers, because the BOS Server does not shutdown the File Server and
Volume Server processes.
</UL>
<P>The Salvager normally salvages only those read/write volumes that are
marked as having been active when a crash occurred. To have it salvage
all relevant read/write volumes, add the <B>-force</B> flag.
<P>The Salvager normally creates new inodes as it repairs damage. If
the partition is so full that there is no room for new inodes, use the
<B>-nowrite</B> argument to bringing undamaged volumes online without
attempting to salvage damaged volumes. Then use the <B>vos move</B>
command to move one or more of the undamaged volumes to other partitions,
freeing up the space that the Salvager needs to create new inodes.
<P>By default, multiple Salvager subprocesses run in parallel&#58; one for
each partition up to four, and four subprocesses for four or more
partitions. To increase or decrease the number of subprocesses running
in parallel, provide a positive integer value for the <B>-parallel</B>
argument.
<P>If there is more than one server partition on a physical disk, the Salvager
by default salvages them serially to avoid the inefficiency of constantly
moving the disk head from one partition to another. However, this
strategy is often not ideal if the partitions are configured as logical
volumes that span multiple disks. To force the Salvager to salvage
logical volumes in parallel, provide the string <B>all</B> as the value
for the <B>-parallel</B> argument. Provide a positive integer to
specify the number of subprocesses to run in parallel (for example,
<B>-parallel 5all</B> for five subprocesses), or omit the integer to run
up to four subprocesses, depending on the number of logical volumes being
salvaged.
<P>The Salvager creates temporary files as it runs, by default writing them to
the partition it is salvaging. The number of files can be quite large,
and if the partition is too full to accommodate them, the Salvager terminates
without completing the salvage operation (it always removes the temporary
files before exiting). Other Salvager subprocesses running at the same
time continue until they finish salvaging all other partitions where there is
enough disk space for temporary files. To complete the interrupted
salvage, reissue the command against the appropriate partitions, adding the
<B>-tmpdir</B> argument to redirect the temporary files to a local disk
directory that has enough space.
<P>The <B>-orphans</B> argument controls how the Salvager handles orphaned
files and directories that it finds on server partitions it is
salvaging. An <I>orphaned</I> element is completely inaccessible
because it is not referenced by the vnode of any directory that can act as its
parent (is higher in the filespace). Orphaned objects occupy space on
the server partition, but do not count against the volume&#39;s quota.
<P>To generate a list of all mount points that reside in one or more volumes,
rather than actually salvaging them, include the <B>-showmounts</B>
flag.
<P><STRONG>Options</STRONG>
<DL>
<P><DT><B>initcmd
</B><DD>Accommodates the command&#39;s use of the AFS command parser, and is
optional.
<P><DT><B>-partition
</B><DD>Specifies the name of the partition to salvage. Specify the full
partition name using the form <B>/vicep</B><VAR>x</VAR> or
<B>/vicep</B><VAR>xx</VAR>. Omit this argument to salvage every
partition on the file server machine.
<P><DT><B>-volumeid
</B><DD>Specifies the volume ID of a specific read/write volume to salvage.
The <B>-partition</B> argument must be provided along with this one and
specify the volume&#39;s actual site.
<P><DT><B>-debug
</B><DD>Allows only one Salvager subprocess to run at a time, regardless of the
setting of the <B>-parallel</B> option. Include it when running the
Salvager in a debugger to make the trace easier to interpret.
<P><DT><B>-nowrite
</B><DD>Brings all undamaged volumes online without attempting to salvage any
damaged volumes.
<P><DT><B>-inodes
</B><DD>Records in the <B>/usr/afs/logs/SalvageLog</B> file a list of all AFS
inodes that the Salvager modified.
<P><DT><B>-force
</B><DD>Inspects all volumes for corruption, not just those that are marked as
having been active when a crash occurred.
<P><DT><B>-oktozap
</B><DD>Removes a volume that is so damaged that even issuing the <B>vos
zap</B> command with the <B>-force</B> flag is ineffective. Use
this argument only in consultation with AFS Development or Product
Support. Combine it with the <B>-partition</B> and
<B>-volumeid</B> arguments to identify the volume to remove.
<P><DT><B>-rootinodes
</B><DD>Records in the <B>/usr/afs/logs/SalvageLog</B> file a list of all AFS
inodes owned by the local superuser <B>root</B>.
<P><DT><B>-salvagedirs
</B><DD>Salvages entire directory structures, even if they do not appear to be
damaged. By default, the Salvager salvages a directory only if it is
flagged as corrupted.
<P><DT><B>-blockreads
</B><DD>Forces the Salvager to read a partition one disk block (512 bytes) at a
time and to skip any blocks that are too badly damaged to be salvaged.
This allows it to salvage as many volumes as possible. By default, the
Salvager reads large disk blocks, which can cause it to exit prematurely if it
encounters disk errors. Use this flag if the partition to be salvaged
has disk errors.
<P><DT><B>-parallel
</B><DD>Specifies the maximum number of Salvager subprocesses to run in
parallel. Provide one of three values&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>An integer from the range <B>1</B> to <B>32</B>. A value of
<B>1</B> means that a single Salvager process salvages the partitions
sequentially.
<P><LI>The string <B>all</B> to run up to four Salvager subprocesses in
parallel on partitions formatted as logical volumes that span multiple
physical disks. Use this value only with such logical volumes.
<P><LI>The string <B>all</B> followed immediately (with no intervening space)
by an integer from the range <B>1</B> to <B>32</B>, to run the
specified number of Salvager subprocesses in parallel on partitions formatted
as logical volumes. Use this value only with such logical
volumes.
</UL>
<P>The BOS Server never starts more Salvager subprocesses than there are
partitions, and always starts only one process to salvage a single
volume. If this argument is omitted, up to four Salvager subprocesses
run in parallel.
<P><DT><B>-tmpdir
</B><DD>Names a local disk directory in which the Salvager places the temporary
files it creates during a salvage operation, instead of writing them to the
partition being salvaged (the default). If the Salvager cannot write to
the specified directory, it attempts to write to the partition being
salvaged.
<P><DT><B>-showlog
</B><DD>Displays on the standard output stream all log data that is being written
to the <B>/usr/afs/logs/SalvageLog</B> file.
<P><DT><B>-showsuid
</B><DD>Displays a list of the pathnames for all files that have the setuid or
setgid mode bit set.
<P><DT><B>-showmounts
</B><DD>Records in the <B>/usr/afs/logs/SalvageLog</B> file all mount points
found in each volume. The Salvager does not repair corruption in the
volumes, if any exists.
<P><DT><B>-orphans
</B><DD>Controls how the Salvager handles orphaned files and directories.
Choose one of the following three values&#58;
<DL>
<P><DT><B>ignore
</B><DD>Leaves the orphaned objects on the disk, but prints a message to the
<B>/usr/afs/logs/SalvageLog</B> file reporting how many orphans were found
and the approximate number of kilobytes they are consuming. This is the
default if the <B>-orphans</B> argument is omitted.
<P><DT><B>remove
</B><DD>Removes the orphaned objects, and prints a message to the
<B>/usr/afs/logs/SalvageLog</B> file reporting how many orphans were
removed and the approximate number of kilobytes they were consuming.
<P><DT><B>attach
</B><DD>Attaches the orphaned objects by creating a reference to them in the vnode
of the volume&#39;s root directory. Since each object&#39;s actual
name is now lost, the Salvager assigns each one a name of the following
form&#58; 
<DL>
<DD><P><B>_ _ORPHANFILE_ _.</B><VAR>index</VAR> for files
<DD><P><B>_ _ORPHANDIR_ _.</B><VAR>index</VAR> for directories
</DL>
<P>
<P>where <VAR>index</VAR> is a two-digit number that uniquely identifies each
object. The orphans are charged against the volume&#39;s quota and
appear in the output of the <B>ls</B> command issued against the
volume&#39;s root directory.
</DL>
<P><DT><B>-help
</B><DD>Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.
</DL>
<P><STRONG>Examples</STRONG>
<P>The following command instructs the Salvager to attempt to salvage the
volume with volume ID 258347486 on <B>/vicepg</B> on the local
machine.
<PRE>   % <B>/usr/afs/bin/salvager -partition /vicepg -volumeid 258347486</B>
   
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Privilege Required</STRONG>
<P>To issue the command at the shell prompt, the issuer must be logged in as
the local superuser <B>root</B>.
