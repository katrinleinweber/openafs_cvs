</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Description</STRONG>
<P>The <B>vos release</B> command copies the contents of the indicated
read/write source volume to each read-only site defined in the source
volume&#39;s Volume Location Database (VLDB) entry. (Use the <B>vos
addsite</B> command to define sites as necessary before issuing this
command). Each read-only copy has the same name as read/write source
with the addition of a <B>.readonly</B> extension.
<P>For users to have a consistent view of the file system, the release of the
new volume version must be atomic&#58; either all read-only sites receive
the new version, or all sites keep the version they currently have. The
<B>vos release</B> command is designed to ensure that all copies of the
volume&#39;s read-only version match both the read/write source and each
other. In cases where problems such as machine or server process
outages prevent successful completion of the release operation, AFS uses two
mechanisms to alert the administrator.
<P>First, the command interpreter generates an error message on the standard
error stream naming each read-only site that did not receive the new volume
version. Second, during the release operation the Volume Location (VL)
Server marks site definitions in the VLDB entry with flags (<TT>New
release</TT> and <TT>Old release</TT>) that indicate whether or not the
site has the new volume version. If any flags remain after the
operation completes, it was not successful. The Cache Manager refuses
to access a read-only site marked with the <TT>Old release</TT> flag, which
potentially imposes a greater load on the sites marked with the <TT>New
release</TT> flag. It is important to investigate and eliminate the
cause of the failure and then to issue the <B>vos release</B> command as
many times as necessary to complete the release without errors.
<P>The pattern of site flags remaining in the volume&#39;s VLDB entry after a
failed release operation can help determine the point at which the operation
failed. Use the <B>vos examine</B> or <B>vos listvldb</B>
command to display the VLDB entry. The VL Server sets the flags in
concert with the Volume Server&#39;s operations, as follows&#58;
<OL TYPE=1>
<P><LI>Before the operation begins, the VL Server sets the <TT>New release</TT>
flag on the read/write site definition in the VLDB entry and the <TT>Old
release</TT> flag on read-only site definitions (unless the read-only site
has been defined since the last release operation and has no actual volume, in
which case its site flag remains <TT>Not released</TT>).
<P><LI>If necessary, the Volume Server creates a temporary copy (a
<I>clone</I>) of the read/write source called the ReleaseClone (see the
following discussion of when the Volume Server does or does not create a new
ReleaseClone.) It assigns the ReleaseClone its own volume ID number,
which the VL Server records in the <TT>RClone</TT> field of the source
volume&#39;s VLDB entry.
<P><LI>The Volume Server distributes a copy of the ReleaseClone to each read-only
site defined in the VLDB entry. As the site successfully receives the
new clone, the VL Server sets the site&#39;s flag in the VLDB entry to
<TT>New release</TT>.
<P><LI>When all the read-only copies are successfully released, the VL Server
clears all the <TT>New release</TT> site flags. The ReleaseClone is
no longer needed, so the Volume Server deletes it and the VL Server erases its
ID from the VLDB entry.
</OL>
<P>By default, the Volume Server determines automatically whether or not it
needs to create a new ReleaseClone&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>If there are no flags (<TT>New release</TT>, <TT>Old release</TT>, or
<TT>Not released</TT>) on site definitions in the VLDB entry, the previous
<B>vos release</B> command completed successfully and all read-only sites
currently have the same volume. The Volume Server infers that the
current <B>vos release</B> command was issued because the read/write
volume has changed. The Volume Server creates a new ReleaseClone and
distributes it to all of the read-only sites.
<P><LI>If any site definition in the VLDB entry is marked with a flag, either the
previous release operation did not complete successfully or a new read-only
site was defined since the last release. The Volume Server does not
create a new ReleaseClone, instead distributing the existing ReleaseClone to
sites marked with the <TT>Old release</TT> or <TT>Not released</TT>
flag. As previously noted, the VL Server marks each VLDB site
definition with the <TT>New release</TT> flag as the site receives the
ReleaseClone, and clears all flags after all sites successfully receive
it.
</UL>
<P>To override the default behavior, forcing the Volume Server to create and
release a new ReleaseClone to the read-only sites, include the <B>-f</B>
flag. This is appropriate if, for example, the data at the read/write
site has changed since the existing ReleaseClone was created during the
previous release operation.
<P><STRONG>Options</STRONG>
<DL>
<P><DT><B>-id
</B><DD>Specifies either the complete name or volume ID number of a read/write
volume.
<P><DT><B>-f
</B><DD>Creates a new ReleaseClone and distributes it all read-only sites
regardless of whether or not any site definitions in the VLDB entry are marked
with a flag.
<P><DT><B>-cell
</B><DD>Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the <B>-localauth</B> flag. For more details, see the
introductory <B>vos</B> reference page.
<P><DT><B>-noauth
</B><DD>Assigns the unprivileged identity <B>anonymous</B> to the
issuer. Do not combine this flag with the <B>-localauth</B>
flag. For more details, see the introductory <B>vos</B> reference
page.
<P><DT><B>-localauth
</B><DD>Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
<B>/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile</B> file. The <B>vos</B> command
interpreter presents it to the Volume Server and Volume Location Server during
mutual authentication. Do not combine this flag with the
<B>-cell</B> argument or <B>-noauth</B> flag. For more details,
see the introductory <B>vos</B> reference page.
<P><DT><B>-verbose
</B><DD>Produces on the standard output stream a detailed trace of the
command&#39;s execution. If this argument is omitted, only warnings
and error messages appear.
<P><DT><B>-help
</B><DD>Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.
</DL>
<P><STRONG>Examples</STRONG>
<P>The following command clones the read/write volume <B>usr</B> and
releases it to the read-only sites defined in its VLDB entry.
<PRE>   % <B>vos release usr</B>
   
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Privilege Required</STRONG>
<P>The issuer must be listed in the <B>/usr/afs/etc/UserList</B> file on
the machine specified with the <B>-server</B> argument and on each
database server machine. If the <B>-localauth</B> flag is included,
the issuer must instead be logged on to a server machine as the local
superuser <B>root</B>.
