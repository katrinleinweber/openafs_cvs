<h1>Configuring identifications to obtain tokens for AFS cells</h1>

<p>
The OpenAFS plug-in maintains a list of AFS cells for each identification.
A list is created the first time AFS tokens are obtained for an
identification or when the list of cells is 
specified in the identification configuration panels.  Each AFS cell that
is listed is associated with a method by which a token should
be obtained and the name of the Kerberos realm that is used to
obtain the service ticket (more details are provided in the <a
href="token_methods.htm">Token Aquisition Methods</a> topic).
</p>

<p>The following sections detail the process by which AFS cells can be
specified when obtaining new credentials or configuring identifications.
</p>

<h3>Specifying AFS cells when obtaining new credentials</h3>

<p>
When the OpenAFS plug-in is installed, it enhances the NetIDMgr new credentials
dialog with an AFS tokens options panel.  A typical new
credentials dialog is shown below demonstrating AFS cells listed in the
credentials summary window.
</p>

<p><img src="images/window_nc_main.bmp" alt="New credentials window showing AFS cells in the credentials summary window" /></p>

<p>Clicking on the <span class="pre">AFS</span> link in the
credentials summary window will take you to the AFS options page.
Alternatively, you can select the <span class="pre">Options
&gt;&gt;</span> button which expands the dialog to show the
credentials type buttons, and then click the <span
class="pre">AFS</span> button at the bottom of the expanded dialog.
</p>

<p>The AFS identification options page is shown below</p>

<p><img src="images/window_nc_afs_0.bmp" alt="AFS identification options page" /></p>

<p>This page allows you to specify if AFS tokens are obtained for this
identification and if so, for which tokens and by which method will they be
obtained.  By unchecking the <span class="pre">Obtain AFS
tokens</span> checkbox, you can prevent AFS tokens from being obtained
for this idenfication.
</p>

<p>Once the new credentials dialog successfully completes, the list of
cells will be saved with the identification.  The next
time you obtain new credentials for the identification, the list of cells
will be loaded automatically.  This list can be edited either by using
the new credentials dialog or the identity configuration
panels. (See <a href="#persistent_tokens">Changing persistent tokent lists</a>).
</p>

<h4>To add a cell:</h4>
<p>
<ul>

<li>Specify the name of the cell in the <span class="pre">Cell</span>
text box.</li>

<li>Specify the Kerberos realm for the service ticket in the <span
class="pre">Realm</span> text box.  Note that you can select <span
class="pre">(Automatic)</span> as the realm to allow the OpenAFS
plug-in to select the realm.  For most cases, you don't need to specify
the realm manually and can safely leave the <span
class="pre">Realm</span> as <span class="pre">(Automatic)</span></li>

<li>Specify the token acquisition method in the <span
class="pre">Method</span>.  You can select <span
class="pre">(Automatic)</span> as the method to allow the OpenAFS
plug-in to select the method automatically.  Similar to the automatic
realm selection, for most cases the plug-in will be able to correctly
select the token aquisition method.  More details about credentials
acquisition methods are provided in the <a
href="token_methods.htm">Token Acquisition Methods</a> topic.</li>

<li>Select the <span class="pre">Add/Update</span> button to add the
cell.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>Note that only one token can exist per cell per login session.
Which means that if you already have a token for cell <em>X</em> while
you are logged in as user <em>A</em>, then you can't have another
token for cell <em>X</em>.  This means that only one identification can 
obtain a token for a given cell.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you try to add a cell to an identification which is
already listed in the persistent cell list for another identification or
which currently exists under a different identification, you will receive a
warning such as the following:
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/window_nc_prob.bmp" alt="Message displaying warning about a duplicate cell" />
</p>

<p>From here, you can decide to keep the cell listed for both
identifications (although only one of them can be active at any given
time), or remove the cell from all the other identifications and add it to
the current one.  Also, you can cancel the add cell request.
</p>

<h4>To modify a cell</h4>
<p>
<ul>

<li>Select the cell from the list of cells.  The cell name, realm and
method in the text boxes will be updated to display the information
from the cell just selected.</li>

<li>Make changes to the realm and method fields as appropriate</li>

<li>Select <span class="pre">Add / Update</span> to update the
information in the cell list</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>Note that if you don't click the <span class="pre">Add /
Update</span>, the cell entry will not be updated.
</p>

<h4>To delete cells</h4>

<p>
<ul>

<li>Select the cells you want to delete from the cell list.  You can
select multiple cells by clicking while holding the <span
class="pre">Ctrl</span> key.</li>

<li>Select the <span class="pre">Delete</span> button.</span></li>

</ul>
</p>

<h4>Cell states</h4>

<p>When you add cells or when you view the cell list, you will see
an icon next to each cell name.  This icon represents the current state of
the cell's token.  You can double-click on the cell to get details about the
state.
</p>

<p>
<div class="inline"><img src="images/window_nc_afs_1.bmp" /></div>
Token for cell <span class="pre">foo.bar</span> is a new token while
the token for <span class="pre">net.mit.edu</span> is in a problem
state.  Double clicking the problem token will display a balloon
prompt indicating what the problem is.

<h3>Changing persistent cell lists for existing identifications</h3>

<p>
The configuration panel for a persistent identification contains a panel for
specifying the AFS cells.  This panel is identical to the panel used
by the new credentials dialog.  You can easily modify the cell lists
as described above and click <span class="pre">Apply</span> and you
are done.
</p>

<p>The AFS configuration panel for an identification is shown below.</p>

<p><img src="images/window_cfg_afs_0.bmp" /></p>

<p>You can reach this configuration panel by opening the configuration
dialog (<span class="pre">Options</span> menu), and then clicking the
persistent identification you need to modify options for.</p>
