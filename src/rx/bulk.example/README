The files in this directory can be made (use make or build) into a simple system
to demonstrate a means of doing bulk transfer with Rx.

Run the server, bulk_server, with no arguments.

Bulk_client is run by:

	bulk_client [-verbose] -store/-fetch localFile remoteHost remoteFile

The verbose flag is forwarded to the server process.  The specified local file is stored or fetched from the remote file at the indicated host.
