Notes on Coding Standards/Requirements for OpenAFS Source
---------------------------------------------------------

Do not use $< in any cross-platform dir as it requires a reasonable
make that is not available on all systems.

Be careful with prototypes/ANSI-C in code that will be compiled for
kernel source.  In general, avoid them until we have figured out
exactly when/where they can be used safely.
