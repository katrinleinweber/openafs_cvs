Short instructions for sites upgrading from a previous version of AFS:
% ./configure --enable-transarc-paths
% make
% make dest

will create a Transarc-style dest tree in ${SYS_NAME}/dest where
${SYS_NAME} is the AFS sysname of the system you built for.
This assumes if you're building for Linux that your kernel source is
in /usr/src/linux.

Otherwise, please read on.

Building OpenAFS on UNIX and LINUX
----------------------------------

A. Creating the proper directory structure.

   Uncompress the source into a directory of your choice. A directory
   in afs space is also valid. In the directory that you uncompressed the
   source in, you will only have an src/ directory.

   1. Pick a system to build for, and note its default AFS sys_name.
      A directory will be automatically created for binaries to be written 
      into with this name when you build.

      alpha_dux40
      alpha_dux50 (only tested on 5.0A)
      i386_linux22
      i386_linux24 (only tested with 2.4.0 kernel)
      rs_aix42
      sgi_65 (file server not tested)
      sun4x_56
      sun4x_57
      sun4x_58
      sun4x_59
      ppc_darwin_13
      ppc_linux22
      ppc_linux24
      alpha_linux22 (DES does not work, will require one more change to
				compile)
      hp_ux110 (No client support, but db servers and utilities work)
      hp_ux102 (No client support, but db servers and utilities work)

   2. Using configure in the top level directory, configure for your
      AFS system type, providing the necessary flags:
      % ./configure --with-afs-sysname=sun4x_58 --enable-transarc-paths

      For Linux systems you need also provide the path in which your
      kernel headers for your configured kernel can be found. This should
      be the path of the directory containing a child directory named
      "include". So if your version file was 
      /usr/src/linux/include/linux/version.h you would invoke:
      % ./configure --with-afs-sysname=i386_linux24 --with-linux-kernel-headers=/usr/src/linux

      Currently you can build for only one Linux kernel at a time,
      and the version is extracted from the kernel headers in the root
      you specify.

      Be prepared to provide the switches --enable-obsolete and
      --enable-insecure if you require the use of any bundled but obsolete
      or insecure software included with OpenAFS. See README.obsolete and
      README.insecure for more details.

  There are two modes for directory path handling: "Transarc mode" and "default mode":
  - In Transarc mode, we retain compatibility with Transarc/IBM AFS tools
    by putting client configuaration files in /usr/vice/etc, and server
    files in /usr/afs under the traditional directory layout.
  - In default mode, files are located in standardized locations, usually
    under $(prefix).
  - Client programs, libraries, and related files always go in standard
    directories under $(prefix).  This rule covers things that would go
    into $(bindir), $(includedir), $(libdir), $(mandir), and $(sbindir).
  - Other files get located in the following places:

    Directory     Transarc Mode              Default Mode
    ============  =========================  ==============================
    viceetcdir    /usr/vice/etc              $(sysconfdir)/openafs
    afssrvdir     /usr/afs/bin (servers)     $(libexecdir)/openafs
    afsconfdir    /usr/afs/etc               $(sysconfdir)/openafs/server
    afslocaldir   /usr/afs/local             $(localstatedir)/openafs
    afsdbdir      /usr/afs/db                $(localstatedir)/openafs/db
    afslogdir     /usr/afs/logs              $(localstatedir)/openafs/logs
    afsbosconfig  $(afslocaldir)/BosConfig   $(afsconfdir)/BosConfig
    afsbosserver  $(afsbindir)/bosserver     $(sbindir)/bosserver


B  Building

   1. Now, you can build OpenAFS. 

      % make

   2. Install your build using either "make install" to install 
      into the current system (you will need to be root, and files
      will be placed as appropriate for Transarc or standard paths),
      "make install DESTDIR=/some/path" to install into an alternate 
      directory tree, or if you configured with --enable-transarc-paths
      make dest to create a complete binary tree in the dest directory      
      under the directory named for the sys_name you built for,
      e.g. sun4x_57/dest or i386_linux22/dest 

   2. As appropriate you can clean up or, if you're using Linux, build for
      another kernel version:
      a. To clean up:
         % make clean

      b. To build for another Linux kernel version:
         the system type defined in step A1.
         % ./configure --with-afs-sysname=i386_linux22 --with-linux-kernel-headers=/usr/src/linux-2.2.19-i686
         % make 

         Your dest tree will now include an additional kernel module for your
         additional kernel headers. Be aware that if the kernel version string
         which UTS_RELEASE is defined to in include/linux/version.h matches
         the last kernel you built for, the previous kernel module will be 
         overwritten.
